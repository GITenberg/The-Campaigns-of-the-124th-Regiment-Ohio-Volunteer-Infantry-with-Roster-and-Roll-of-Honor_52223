  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The campaigns of the One Hundred and
Twenty-fourth Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry,
if written at all, should have been written
nearer the close of the war, while the stirring
scenes and events of those years of daring, duty
and glory were vivid in the mind of the writer.
The "Campaigns" should have been written by
one that had intended to write them from the
first, and had made such due and proper preparation
during the time the same were going
forward as would enable him to collect the necessary
data for a correct and valuable history of
the men, the companies and the regiment as an
entirety. The "Campaigns" should have been
written by one that had as full knowledge of the
entire regiment as the author of these imperfect
sketches had of the company he commanded
during the service. Some of these campaigns
were written for the purpose of preserving the
events therein narrated, and by solicitation were
delivered before the "permanent organization"
of the regiment at its annual reunions, held from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>time to time, in the vicinity where the regiment
was organized. Some, by mere chance, were
published in the soldier papers of the country,
and copied into others; but not until very recently
did their author contemplate putting them
into their present form, and only after a very
strong desire had been expressed by the regiment,
at one of its reunions, that some attempt
should be made to preserve the deeds of the
heroic men, living and dead, that composed one
of the truest and best regiments that ever
marched beneath the colors of the republic, did
the author determine to undertake the work that
is now consummated.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the opinion of the author, in putting this
book into the hands of those who did so much
to make the history it seeks to perpetuate, that
the most striking thing about it is its imperfections,
its inaccuracies. And this, to a certain extent,
needs be so, as the events it commemorates
were written, almost altogether, from memory,
and that after more than twenty-five years after
the facts narrated took place; and many a time,
while recalling those marches, battles and sufferings
of those brave men that struggled "to keep
the flag in the sky during all those dark years,"
it occurred to the author—could he only have the
memory of each of the survivors of that grand
body of men, how much more complete, accurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>and interesting his work would be to them
for the perusal of whom it is intended. And
again, the experiences of a modest, but quite
busy, professional career, for many years, has
taught the author that the same event is never
seen by all alike, never remembered by all alike,
and could not be written by all alike, though all
were equally desirous to tell nothing but the
truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>In these "Campaigns" there has been no desire
to gloss over the mistakes and imperfections
of the actors of the greatest drama that was ever
enacted in the world's history; but in the criticism
of them the author has had continually in
mind the fact that, generally, all was done with
the best endeavor, with a purpose and patriotism
that has not a parallel in history. And sometimes
it seems to be better to note a few faults,
that the work may seem real, not fabulous; that
we write of men, not of angels.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the original purpose to present engravings
from portraits of the field and staff, the
original captains of the companies and some
others, but too much time had run to carry out,
entirely, this design. We could not publish engravings
of each member of the regiment, though
we are aware that nearly all are worthy of such
honor, and we thought to be content with publishing
engravings of the representative men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the regiment, but in this we have succeeded only
in part.</p>

<p class='c000'>The "Roster and Roll of Honor" attached
to the "Campaigns" is the one published by the
direction and authority of the State of Ohio.
It is far from being perfect, but the best that
could be furnished, under all the circumstances,
and is worth a great deal more to each member
of the regiment in the form presented herein,
than it is as published by the authority of the
state.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now we say, go, thou little imperfect production,
into the hands and homes of those with
whom we served, suffered, and still love. If this
poor souvenir of so good a service, and so many
and great sacrifices, revives the memories and
stirs those brave hearts to whose services no pen
and no tongue can do justice, our desires are
accomplished.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>FROM CLEVELAND, OHIO, TO MANCHESTER, TENN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Regiment,
Ohio Volunteer Infantry, was born of the
great impulse of patriotism that swept over the
country in the latter part of the summer of 1862,
occasioned by the necessity for the "300,000
more" to put down the slaveholder's rebellion.
The greater part of the regiment volunteered
without the aid of a recruiting officer. Company
A was raised in Cuyahoga county, and the patriotic
and earnest William Wilson, afterwards
its captain, seconded by that most enthusiastic
of men, Cleveland Van Dorn, afterwards captain
of Company D, were the leading spirits around
which the brave men, that afterwards were mustered
into the service of the United States as
Co. A, 124th O. V. I., gathered, and became in
fact what they were by letter, the first of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>regiment. Company A was organized with the
intention of becoming a part of the 103d O.
V. I., but on going into camp, Captain Wilson
found that regiment already full, and finally determined
to join his fortunes, and that of his
noble men, with those of the 124th O. V. I., to
which regiment Oliver H. Payne had been commissioned
as lieutenant colonel, and James Pickands,
formerly of the 1st O. V. I., as major.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company B was organized, almost exclusively,
from the young men of the western townships
of Medina county. Spencer township furnished
the greater number, some forty enlisting
from that township in one day, August 12th.
Litchfield township furnished a goodly number,
while Homer, Harrisville, Chatham, La Fayette
helped to swell the ranks, while a few came from
Wayne, some from Lorain, and later the youngest
member, John M. Bowman, was consigned
by his patriotic mother, residing in Cleveland, to
the care of Company B. This company, or rather
body of men, was sent into Camp Cleveland by
order of the Military Committee of Medina
county, composed of Judge Samuel Humphreville,
John B. Young, Esq., and Mr. John Rounds.
This body of men, by the intercessions of the
committee with Governor Todd, was suffered
to elect its commissioned officers, and, as the result,
George W. Lewis was chosen captain, John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Raidaie, first lieutenant, and Charles M. Stedman,
second lieutenant. When this company
came to be mustered into the service of the
United States, it had so many men that a number
of them had to be mustered in other companies,
and were afterwards transferred back to
the company in which they had enlisted. This
was also the experience of Company A.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company C was mostly raised in Cuyahoga,
and Robert Wallace, afterwards its captain, and
John O'Brien, afterwards its second lieutenant,
seemed to be the nucleus around which the
good men of Company C appeared to form.
Many of them were from the "Emerald Isle,"
and proved their honor and daring on many hard
fought fields of the campaigns of the regiment
in after days.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company E came in from Lorain county, and
John W. Bullock was made its captain. But
time and space forbid a more extended notice
of the different parts of an organization that was
first-class, singly, or as a whole, more than to
say that Company D was brought into camp by
Captain George W. Aumend, the company being
raised mostly in Henry county. Company
F was raised from the northern part of the state,
and was commanded by Captain Horace E.
Dakin. Company G had many men from Cincinnati,
but was, in fact, recruited from all parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of the state. Captain William A. Powell was
its first captain. Company H was recruited,
mostly, in Cleveland, and its first captain was
that accomplished officer, Eben S. Coe. Company
I was largely from Cincinnati, with the late
lamented James H. Frost as its first captain,
while Company K seemed to be a sort of an
overflow from almost anywhere. Hiram H.
Manning was its first captain, and he was not
mustered as such until November 10th, 1863. It
seemed for a long time to be a sort of "motherless
colt" of the regiment, and fared accordingly,
but it never failed in action, if it did not always
have the care a company should have.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Camp Cleveland we took our first lesson
as soldiers. Here the "Awkward Squad" might
have been seen, at almost all hours of sunlight,
being drilled by one a very little less awkward
than themselves. The "halt," "right-dress,"
"forward," "steady there," "eyes right," "eyes
left," "right wheel," etc., etc., given in the tones
of a Stentor, might have been heard on the
parade grounds of Camp Cleveland, in season
and out of season, during all the fall and early
winter of 1862. We were not well up in the
manual of arms here, as I do not remember that
we had muskets for all the men in this camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Camp Cleveland, during the time our regiment
was there, was a hard place for the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>volunteer. Calls were constantly being made
by the relatives of the volunteers, and visits were
constantly being solicited and made to the old
homes, so that, in time, the best officer(?) was the
one that granted the greatest number of "leaves
of absence." Under such circumstances, anything
like the discipline necessary to perfect the
raw but patriotic volunteer into the well drilled
and efficient soldier was out of the question, and
many a line officer was relieved of a very heavy
burden when January 1st, 1863, came, and our
regiment was furnished transportation toward the
seat of war. None of the living members of the
124th will have forgotten the terrible snowstorm
at Elizabethtown, Ky.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the first of February, 1863, it seems a
large number of regiments were assembled at
and near Louisville, Ky., to be forwarded to
augment the Army of the Cumberland, under
the then victorious, and very popular, General
Rosecrans. Our regiment was paid off before
we started on that ever memorable expedition
"down the Ohio," and up the Cumberland river
to Nashville, Tenn. Those were the times that
tried the souls of the company commandant.
We had never been mustered for pay, and without
anyone, at first, to instruct us, that which
afterwards seemed very simple, was then a
mountain of responsibility and worry. The captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>that could not get his muster rolls so they
would pass the inspection of that prince among
gentlemen, Paymaster Major John Coon, could
not have his company paid, and anxiety is never
a very great auxiliary to the completion of a
new and hard task. But those of us that
looked upon this financial officer in a sense akin
to dread, found him a genial schoolmaster, and
he not only instructed us in our duties, but followed
us down the river until the last company
of our regiment had received its pay. The larger
share of this money was sent home to wives and
children, and friends (some to creditors) in our
own Ohio.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have often wondered why the government
did not march this force, that was assembled at
Louisville, to Nashville. The distance was one
hundred and eighty miles, connected by one of
the best macadamized roads in the country; and
could we have been permitted to make the
march by easy stages, we would have been half
soldiers by the time we reached Nashville, and
in a condition of health and soldierly prosperity
very much to be desired. But the way we were
sent by the old stern-wheelers, it occupied eleven
days to make the trip, with no fire to keep us
comfortable or for cooking our rations, while
the nights were spent in shivering on the cheerless
decks of those old wheezy and stinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>boats, which to all appearances had not been
cleaned since the carpenters laid their keels.
Many a man was lost to the service of his country
from this method of his transportation, and
many a man dates the loss of his health from
those eleven days of suffering and exposure.
But whoever writes of wars must write of mistakes;
but we will think that everything was intended
for our good, by those that had the good
of the country in their keeping. The night we
approached Nashville, we heard heavy firing up
the river, and found the next morning on coming
up to the site of Fort Donelson, that a portion
of Wheeler's command had made an attack
upon the small garrison, and had been repulsed
with a very severe loss, considering the number
engaged.</p>

<p class='c000'>We went ashore and saw the dead confederates
lying all about a piece of artillery, that it
seems they had endeavored to take by charging
the same; but the gun manned by the brave
Illinoisans that composed the garrison, made
fearful havoc in the ranks of Wheeler. The
officer that lead the charge, Col. Overton, lay
dead near the piece, and we were told he was
the same man that owned the estate where we
first made our camp in Tennessee. The killed
of the garrison had been gathered under a shed,
and were composed in what seemed to me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>be a long row, and as I looked upon their upturned
faces, pallid in death, and ghastly with
wounds, I thought I had already seen enough
of war. We returned to our boat, and steamed
slowly up to Nashville. Going from Donelson
to Nashville we saw the river gunboat, Concord.
It was claimed that this boat had taken part in
the fight of the day before, and we looked upon
it, not only with curiosity, but with admiration,
it being the first specimen of Uncle Sam's navy
that many of us had ever seen. On arriving at
the levee at Nashville, we disembarked, and forming
the regiment in column of company front,
with our band playing, and colors flying, we
marched through the principal street of the city.
But how different from Cleveland, O. Not a
friendly face greeted us. Hardly a citizen was
to be seen on the streets, and not a salute nor a
shout welcomed us to this one of the most treasonable
cities of the confederacy. We now, for
the first time, realized that we were in the land
of the rebellion. We moved that evening out
to Overton Heights on the Franklin pike, and
went into camp on the very spot where the
same regiment, as veteran soldiers, on the sixteenth
day of December, 1864, scattered the last
of Hood's infantry on the memorable field of
Nashville.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few days we marched to the village of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Franklin, eighteen miles by the pike from Nashville.
This march was a very trying ordeal for
us green soldiers. The most of the men carried
luggage enough to overload a mule, and such
knapsacks as the men staggered under in this
little march, would have been a matter of amusement
later in the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>On arriving at Franklin, we went into camp
on the north side of the Harpeth river, that
forms the northern boundary of the village, and
commenced soldier life in earnest. This place
was occupied as an outpost of General Van
Dorn's division of Bragg's army, but what few
rebels were on duty here did not seem to care
to try titles with us. Here, our major, James B.
Hampson, came to us, and being a member of
the old Cleveland Grays, and also having seen
service in one of the earlier regiments of the
Ohio troops, was a very valuable acquisition to
us in the way of an instructor. His soldierly
bearing and pleasant manner won all our hearts.
He instructed us in the "manual of arms,"
taught us the "load in nine times," while in
regimental and brigade drill he was a regular
God-send to the ignorant officers of the line, that
the most of us were. Here we had to attend
the "school for the officer" and recite from
Casey's Tactics to our young colonel, and many
the hour we spent with him, ere the, to us, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>that time, mysterious positions in which a regiment
could be formed were thoroughly mastered.
Some of our officers could learn nothing
from books; but for school-teachers, like Captain
Van Dorn, and preachers, like Captain Stratton, it
was nothing but fun to repair to the Colonel's
quarters to recite to one that had an earnest desire
to make capable officers of us all. We were
now in the presence of the enemy, and Forrest's
cavalry used often to lope up to our pickets to
see what we looked like; and it was no infrequent
occurrence for the dreaded "long-roll" to
call us from our slumbers to stand at arms for
an hour on the regimental parade ground. I
remember one morning that we were thus called
out, and Company C, under Lieutenant O'Brien,
was a little late in taking its place in the line.
Soon we heard it coming on the double quick,
while the "rich Irish brogue" of the lieutenant
in getting his company into line attracted our
attention more than any advance of the enemy
that we apprehended (for by this time we had
discovered that this standing at arms was a
scheme of old granny Gilbert to give our hospitals
practice); finding his place in the line, in
some way, his last command was, "Sthand fast
company <em>say</em>, and I'll lay me bones wid ye."</p>

<p class='c000'>In the school of the officer, I remember his
attempt at recitation that ran something like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>this: "The ordly sagint thin advances tin paces,
surrur! nah!—two paces—I don't know, surrur."
The big-hearted Irishman, that did the fine work
on the Perry monument, cutting the guard chain
of his watch out of the solid marble, at last
learned that he was not intended for an officer,
though brave and patriotic, tendered his resignation,
and that was the last we ever saw or
heard of Lieutenant John O'Brien.</p>

<p class='c000'>But while instructions in the movements of the
company and regiment were necessary, and we
all tried to profit by the same, facility in recitation
did not necessarily make the valuable officer.
As an instance, our Methodist minister,
Captain Daniel Stratton, was Wonderfully fluent
at the recitations, and became quite well drilled,
but at our first great battle, Chickamauga, he deserted
his company, as we were coming into the
action, <em>in the face of the enemy</em>, and was saved
from the fate of his conduct by the great heart
of Colonel Pickands. He said to the colonel,
"when I thought of my wife and dear children
at home I could not advance a single step towards
the front." But he advanced pretty well
towards the rear, for after two days of dreadful
fighting and the third day in offering battle to
an enemy, nominally victors, but thoroughly
whipped (save the magazine writers), we came
to Chattanooga and found our preacher in very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>comfortable quarters, with his resignation ready
written out, which was accepted by our regimental
commandant. Could our Irish lieutenant
have done worse? The march, the campaign, the
skirmish line, the picket duty, the battle, after all,
were the true tests of soldierly qualities. Many
a man, many an officer, arose in our estimation,
after we saw him tried in the ordeal of battle,
for whom we entertained but very little respect
before.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Franklin we had to do picket duty by company
out south of the village, our line running
along near the residence of one of the high-toned
families of the town, by the name of Atkinson.
At his residence our reserve post was
established, and we posted a guard to protect
the family, which consisted of the old gentleman,
quite aged, his wife and a beautiful daughter,
bearing the common but genial name of Sally.
There were two sons, but both were serving in
General Frank Cheatham's division of the rebel
army. Sally was quite an expert singer, and
played the piano reasonably well, and, to entertain
us, she was kind enough to sing some of
the war songs of the confederacy. I remember
pieces of those songs to this day; one went like
this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Hurrah, hurrah, for southern rights hurrah,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hurrah for the bonny blue flag, that bears the single star."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>And another:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"No northern flag shall ever wave</div>
      <div class='line'>O'er southern soil and southern graves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Look away, look away, look away, Dixie land,</div>
      <div class='line'>In Dixie land we'll take our stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And conquer peace for Dixie."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These rebel war songs and others might have
been heard floating out on the soft evening air,
near the old locust grove, and no one of the brave
men that did duty there thought any the less of
the pert and plucky rebel girl. We laughed at
her wit and the raillery that she heaped on us,
calling us invaders. But the colonel of the 125th
was one day on duty as officer of the day, and
hearing of the rebel girl and her songs, reported
the matter to old granny Gilbert, who issued an
order that had the effect of an injunction, and
we heard no more of the sweet voice of Sally
Atkinson while we did duty at Franklin. Colonel
Opdyke was an excellent officer in many
respects, but a pronounced martinet, and had
not a particle of humor in his composition.
There was a rumor in the regiment that our
Colonel Jim, as we sometimes called him, was
a little sweet on Sally, but I think there was
nothing of it, and for the sad fate of Sally and
her two brothers, see the last campaign of this
book.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had not been long in Franklin before our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>experience in transportation, heretofore referred
to, began to have its deadly effect. The typhoid
fever and camp diarrhœa became alarmingly
common. Our men sickened and were sent to
the general hospital at Nashville, where very
many died, and many were discharged, as unfit
for further military duty. Not any one of the
hard fought battles of our campaigns so depleted
our ranks as our stay at Franklin. The
water was of the limestone formation, and did
not seem to agree with those that were comparatively
well, much less those that were sick.
I think that every old soldier will agree with
me that the march, while more fatiguing, is
more healthful than the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>While at Franklin we had the misfortune to
be under the command of one General Gilbert,
a regular army officer. A man that the government
had educated at great expense at West
Point, and had kept in service for years after,
and yet had no process of determining that he
had no sense.</p>

<p class='c000'>This man, that might possibly have commanded
a company under a careful colonel,
was placed in command of all the forces around
Franklin. I am sorry to say it was under the
command of this imbecile that we first met the
enemy. Colonel Coburn's brigade, which was
composed of the 85th and 33d Ind. V. I., the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>19th Mich. V. I., the 22d Wis. V. I., the 2d Mich.
Cav., a part of the 4th Ky., and a part of the 9th
Pa. Cav., with a light battery of six guns and a
small train of wagons for forage, was ordered
in the direction of Columbia. Our regiment
accompanied the expedition as train guard.
We moved a short distance the first day out
and went into camp, having seen a few rebel
cavalry, and having received the fire from a
rebel gun or two that did no damage to us,
save the breaking a musket stock for one of
our men. The next morning we moved out of
camp, and I remember watching the 19th Mich.,
it was such a large, fine looking body of men,
and moved down the pike toward Thompson
Station. Colonel Coburn soon developed the
enemy in force, and so reported to General Gilbert,
who sent back an order for him to advance
and engage the enemy, intimating that the commander
of the brigade was a coward. Colonel
Coburn then advanced and engaged the rebels,
but his little force was outflanked on either side
by the superior numbers of the enemy, and
though fighting heroically, were soon surrounded
and captured, save the battery that
ran over the rebel infantry, and a small part of
the 22d Wis., a part of one company, the cavalry
force; and had it not been for our good
luck in being on duty with the wagons, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>would also have been taken. As it was, nothing
saved us but the best of running, and in a
long race at that. We came into camp that
night badly used up, and very much disgusted
with our old granny Gilbert, having seen and
run away from the battle of Thompson Station.
The government expended Colonel Coburn's
brigade and the lives of many brave men to
learn, what every soldier about Franklin knew
from the first, that Gilbert was not fit to be in
the command of anybody.</p>

<p class='c000'>While at Franklin we built a very fine fort,
situated northwesterly of the village, and near
our camp. The fort was built of earth, regularly
laid out with angles, and a deep moat surrounding
the entire work. The embrasures were well
protected with gabions made of cane bound in
bundles, and in the center a fine magazine was
constructed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Heavy guns were brought from Nashville,
and mounted <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en barbette</span></i>. Why the fort was
built none could tell. The chances that it would
ever be of use to the cause of the Union were
one thousand to one against the proposition,
but at the battle of Franklin, November 30,
1864, it paid large interest on the investment.
Those big smooth-bore guns shelled the cotton
field, south of the village, over which the rebels
charged, in a manner which was fearful to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>behold. We that had worked so many days
on that fort, felt that we were well repaid for
our toil.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the fort was building, it occurred to
Colonel Payne that the "contraband of war"
might be useful in this work, so he ordered
Lieutenant Raidaie to take a detail of men, and
go forth and bring in such of the bondmen as
he could find that were able to do the work
required. So the lieutenant sallied forth in
the direction of Roper's Knob, and he was rewarded
by finding large numbers of the aforesaid
"contraband," as the slave owners of Kentucky
had sent their slaves into Tennessee, to
keep them as far away as possible from the
union lines. These slaves we kept in camp
until the fort was completed, and all that desired
were permitted to return to the places
from whence they were taken; but many of the
younger ones stayed with us, and engaged themselves
as servants to the officers. But it was
wonderful with what alacrity these poor ignorant
colored people performed the work required
of them. They seemed to realize that they were
working for themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>March 9th, 1863, we left our camp at Franklin,
General Gordon Granger in command, and
marched to within about a mile of Spring Hill,
passed by and over the battle field of March 5th,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Thompson Station, but saw no evidences of the
late unequal, but sanguinary contest, save a few
broken guns and some dead horses. We went
into bivouac at night, having no tents with us.
We marched thirteen miles. The next day it
commenced raining and we were all wet to the
skin, but nothing daunted, we went at work and
fixed up shelter, and at about ten a. m. we had
marching orders. We marched about three
miles, it raining all the time. Company B received
a detail to furnish twenty-five men for
picket duty, which was filled with healthy men,
and quite a number of sick men in camp, and
the number ailing in the regiment was far from
being inconsiderable. But we found the next
day that this movement toward Columbia did
not mean anything, and we were ordered back to
Franklin, which was only a march of seventeen
miles, but we came into camp that night as stiff
and sore as foundered horses. We had no battle,
we had lost no men, but take it all in all, we
were the better soldiers for the experience we
had gained.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had now been in Franklin three months,
and had put in the time in all the ways in which
a soldier's life is made up. Now, hardly a day
went by that the rebel cavalry did not appear
at our picket line, and frequently a lively skirmish
would occur between our cavalry and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>detachment of that of our enemy. The losses
of the rebels were always enormous(?) while
ours were entirely insignificant. The early part
of April the rebels made a raid on our rear, and
destroyed a bridge on the railroad about six
miles north of Franklin, which caused us very
much annoyance, for at that period in our history,
as soldiers, we thought we were badly treated if
we did not get our letters regularly from home.</p>

<p class='c000'>June 2d, 1863, was our last at the camp at
Franklin. Here, we had learned very much of
the duties of the soldier. We had not been
slack in our work, and had become quite proficient
in the company, regimental, and brigade
evolutions. Here we had bidden good-bye to
very many of our men, and our companies were
small compared to what they were when we
came to this camp; but our colonel consoled us
by insisting that the fighting number of one
hundred men, for all causes, was about sixty,
and we found afterwards that the estimate of
our young colonel was not far from the mark.
This day we struck our tents, and marched to
Triune, a distance of but thirteen miles, but
the weather was so excessively hot that our
men suffered a great deal; but we had learned
some wisdom from our former experience, for
our knapsacks were not nearly as large as when
we left Nashville. We remained in Triune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>until the twenty-first day of June, during which
time we were stirred up by skirmishes very frequently,
but the skirmishing was done mostly
by the cavalry, on the respective sides, and the
usual large stories were told in camp of our
immense superiority over the enemy. While
at Triune, one of our fellow citizens from Ohio,
C. L. Vallandigham, was sent through our lines
"to his friends in the south," as Mr. Lincoln
humorously put it. We were usually very glad
to see anyone from home, but we were not at
all proud of this representative from Ohio.</p>

<p class='c000'>We now saw what we regarded as indications
of a general advance on the position of
the enemy, and it seemed to be our fate to be
compelled to march to the extreme left of the
army to join the brigade to which we had been
assigned while at Triune. We were assigned
to what was called Hazen's brigade, composed
of the 41st O. V. I., the 9th Ind. V. I., the 93d
O. V. I., the 6th Ky. V. I., and our regiment,
commanded by General Wm. B. Hazen, the
first colonel of the 41st, an officer in every way
qualified for the command assigned him. This
day we marched over the battle field of Stone
river, through the dense cedars that figure so
conspicuously in the descriptions of that terrible
engagement of the closing year of 1862.
We marched through the village of Murfreesborough,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and out one and one-half miles east
of the town, and went into camp, having come
that day a distance of twenty-two miles, with
less fatigue and suffering than any we had
formerly made. The next day we marched to
Readyville, a distance of twelve miles, and found
our brigade. Here we fixed up a nice camp, and
were informed we would stay for some time.
This was as desolate a part of the south as it
was ever our fortune to tread over. It did not
seem to be inhabited to any great extent, and
was as woodsy as Ohio seventy-five years ago.
On the twenty-fourth of June we broke up
our camp and marched directly south through
Bradyville, a city consisting of three houses.
We saw the burning of a great amount of provisions
before leaving Readyville that we concluded
had to be abandoned for lack of transportation.
We marched this day about seven
miles in a very severe rainstorm. We were
now informed that we were after General Bragg,
and we might expect a general engagement at
any time. The next day we marched not to
exceed six or seven miles, and came to a very
long, steep hill that gave our artillery and train
great difficulty in the ascent. The roads we came
over this day were the worst we had so far encountered,
but when we were on the top of this
hill we were on a broad shelf or table-land lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>directly west of the Cumberland mountains that
seemed good for nothing, save to illustrate the
great variety of the works of Almighty God.
The next day we stayed in camp all day, waiting
for our train to come up. It rained almost all
day long. The next day, June 27th, company
B was detailed to help the train along. They
came to what is called the Long Branch of the
Duck river, and the men had to build a brush
bridge across the stream, and after getting mired
in the quicksands time and time again, they
finally succeeded in getting the train over.
This company did not get in to join the regiment
until the next morning, and then came wet,
weary, and not in their usual sweet temper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day, Sunday, we marched but four
miles and camped in a wood (I do not remember
of seeing any fields); but one thing justice
requires to be said for this table-land country, the
water was simply exquisite. We were now reported
to be within forty-two miles of Manchester,
and we were informed that we were now
making a grand flank movement that was to cut
off the retreat of Bragg, and by which we were
to capture his entire army, and, in fact, we were
making this grand flank movement at the rapid(?)
rate of from seven to ten miles per day. On
the twenty-ninth we crossed the east branch of
Duck river and did little but get our train over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>this miry stream. This same weary marching
continued until the fourth day of July, and finds
us on the Elk river, at Morris Ford, awaiting
the arrival of the pontoons. It had rained
almost incessantly for the last fourteen days,
and very many of us had not had our clothing
dry in that time, but the weather was warm and
none of us seemed to take cold; I remember
one day of this march that it was so very hot
that the men fell out in great numbers, and
when we halted at night, no company of the
regiment could show more than one stack of
muskets; but before morning the good faithful
boys came in, and the next day were ready
to resume their arduous duties. On July the
8th we arrived at Manchester, and found that
General Bragg had escaped us, and had crossed
the mountains into the valley of the Tennessee.
We had not seen a rebel since leaving Triune,
and owing to the condition of the country and
roads, if we had seen one he must have been
dead, for we did not move fast enough to overtake
a live one. No battle had been fought,
though one day we heard heavy firing in the
direction of Tullahoma.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so ended the summer for the 124th O.
V. I., and also, in fact, for the Army of the
Cumberland. Although General Rosecrans
had not succeeded in bringing Bragg to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>engagement, he had driven him from middle
Tennessee, the great rebel recruiting ground
for men, animals, and supplies, and while the
victory was bloodless, it was in no small sense
important to the union cause. The unionists
of east Tennessee saw in it their coming deliverance,
while the depressing effect of a retreat
told upon the confederate forces. Since leaving
Franklin our regiment had marched over one
hundred and fifty miles, which, considering the
weather and the state of the roads, was an accomplishment
that had a tendency to increase
our confidence, and prepare us for the more
arduous duties that fell to our lot after we
crossed the great mountains and commenced
operations in the valley of the Tennessee—the
key to the conquest of the confederacy.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SOME RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN OF CHATTANOOGA<br /> AND THE BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If you ask, to-day,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> the young man of twenty-five
years, married and his little ones growing
up in health and peace about him, what he recollects
of the war for the suppression of the rebellion,
his answer must be "nothing." He will
say, "I was not born until after the war had been
on one year. I remember nothing about the
war, as you call it, for the suppression of the
rebellion."</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Written in 1887.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If you ask the man of thirty years, in full business
life, a leader of society, the same question,
his answer will be undoubtedly, "I remember
but little about the war; I was but four years
old when the war broke out. I remember sometime
during the war seeing the soldiers, in their
blue coats and bright buttons and arms, as they
marched along to the station <em>to go to the front</em>,
as they said. I remember hearing the <em>drumbeat</em>,
I recollect feeling the <em>heart-throb</em>, as I saw
the flag which they bore aloft. I was but nine
years old when the war ended. I remember that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>when the boys came back, battered and scarred,
in their dirty and faded uniforms, their flag in
tatters, their faces bronzed and burned by the
southern sun, that of them that met them at the
station many wept, because so many that went
away with them <em>returned not</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'>And so, to the majority of those to-night, the
war is but a matter of history and legend of
story and of song.</p>

<p class='c000'>The recollections of those years from 1861 to
1865 are, in many minds, as indelible as though
graven on brass, or chiseled in marble.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those of you who have personal recollections,
as well as those familiar with the history of those
times, will remember that the summer of 1863,
so far as the Army of the Cumberland was concerned,
was spent (as was at one time said of
the Army of the Potomac) in "masterly inactivity;"
and although after the battle of Stone
river the army occupied a line as far south as
Franklin and Murfreesboro, Tenn. And though
the army, under the now immortal Grant, had
captured one entire rebel army, and had opened
the "Father of Waters," so long closed at Vicksburg;
and though the gallant Meade had met
the invaders at Gettysburg and hurled him back,
in defeat and confusion, to his old lair beyond
the Potomac, the Army of the Cumberland, under
General Rosecrans, as late as August had barely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>gained the foothills of the Cumberland mountains.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cumberland mountains run in a direction
south of west and north of east, and for
most of the way are composed of two considerable
ridges, some two thousand feet above
the valley of the Tennessee. These ridges are
broken at Chattanooga by the Tennessee river,
and so bold and abrupt is Lookout mountain
on the south side of the river, that one can almost
conclude that some great convulsion of nature
had reft it asunder from its corresponding ridge
on the north side.</p>

<p class='c000'>This chain of mountains, this deep and broad
river, lay between our army and that of the enemy
when the march commenced southward in
August, 1863.</p>

<p class='c000'>The corps to which my regiment was attached,
the 21st, under General Crittenden, and the
14th Corps, under General George H. Thomas,
crossed the mountains above Chattanooga, while
General McCook's Corps, and the Reserve Corps
under General Gordon Granger, crossed at and
below Chattanooga.</p>

<p class='c000'>And while in the effort of crossing this great
mountain range and river, the right and left
wings of the army must have been seventy-five
miles apart, and neither near enough to aid the
other in case of an attack. I am almost at a loss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to know how the Army of the Cumberland was
put south of mountains and river; whether by
the ability of Rosecrans, or the stupidity of Bragg,
the feat was accomplished.</p>

<p class='c000'>And while there was many a mountain defile
that would have answered for a modern Thermopylæ,
happily for us the <em>three hundred Spartans</em>
seemed to be wanting.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early part of August, 1863, found us encamped
at Manchester, Tenn., at or near the
head waters of the Duck river after the close of
the Tullahoma campaign, if it is proper to call
that a campaign, that was simply a retreat on the
part of the confederates, and pursuit on the part
of the federal forces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Manchester is situated on what is known as
the table-lands of Tennessee, and though high
and supplied with the most delightful water, very
many of our men were sick by reason of the exposure
on the campaign just closed, and had to
be sent back to hospitals or sent home on furlough,
which latter was very seldom done; and
when accomplished costing great pains and
anxiety. If our national policy had been to furlough
our worthy sick, instead of sending them
off to the inhospitable hospitals, to be experimented
upon by the graduates, fresh from our
medical colleges, to pine away with homesickness,
be crowded together in great numbers "into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the wards of the whitewashed halls, where the
dead and dying lay," when a few days and
weeks at home with its cheering influences and
home diet, <em>something mother could fix up</em>, would
have restored, without doubt, thousands of brave
men to health and duty, that by reason of the
narrow, niggardly, treat-every-man-as-a-coward
policy of the government, went down to needless
and untimely graves.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have read accounts of the neatly arranged
graves of these men with the beautiful marble
headstones, furnished at the expense of the
government, in our great national cemeteries;
but I never think of those great armies of the
dead but I think, <em>how many might have been
saved</em>. Very many of those headstones are
more monuments to the lack of good sense on
the part of the government, than a noble and
patriotic generosity. Nearly all of our soldiers
that died of disease in hospitals, could and
should have been sent home and saved. I remember
very well it was never any trouble
to procure a leave of absence for a sick or
wounded officer, but to procure one for a poor
private in the ranks was altogether a different
matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may not be out of place for me to give you
a brief account of an effort that I made to procure
furloughs for three most worthy sick men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>while at Manchester, just before we started on
the Chattanooga campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>These men were afflicted with that terrible
disease, that with the aid of the government and
its surgeons has slain its tens of thousands,
known as camp or chronic diarrhœa. I made
out an application for furloughs for these men,
knowing full well that the time was very brief,
that we must leave these brave men to the care
of entire strangers—men that did hospital duty,
as they did any other, because they were ordered
to; and knowing full well that, in all human
probability, they would never return to the regiment
if they were sent to the hospital, I determined
to make a great effort to save them. I
procured a very earnest indorsement from our
regimental surgeon, Major Dewitt C. Patterson,
than whom a more competent or kinder hearted
surgeon never had the health of a regiment in
charge, also the very favorable indorsement of
our colonel; but he refused to give me leave to
carry the application to brigade headquarters,
for good reasons, no doubt, as he informed me
that the application must go through the regular
channel. I told him "the application might
get back in time to attend the funeral, but never
to do these men any good." I immediately
went to the headquarters of the brigade commandant;
he examined carefully the application,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>wanted to know the urgency of the matter, and
after I had explained to him all I could, and
after I had urged everything I could think of that
I thought would help the case of the sick men,
he coolly took the application from my hands,
indorsed it "disallowed," and ordered me to
my regiment, saying, "we are not granting furloughs
on the eve of starting on a campaign."</p>

<p class='c000'>I was somewhat disheartened, but not altogether
discouraged. I immediately repaired to
General Palmer's headquarters, who commanded
the division. The general treated me with
great politeness, heard all I had to say, and then
informed me that no furloughs were being
granted; said "he would excuse me for bringing
up the application without leave," kindly ordered
me to my regiment, and advised me "give
up the enterprise, if I wished to save myself
from the disgrace of a court-martial," which, as
we soldiers all know, is a <em>court organized to
convict</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>I then turned my steps toward the headquarters
of General Crittenden, commanding our
corps; he treated me with great brusqueness,
not only refusing the indorsement I so much
desired, but severely censured me for not sending
the application through the regular channel.
He gave me the usual complimental (?) order,
"Immediately repair to your regiment, sir!" I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>was "cast down, but not destroyed;" I had just
one ground of hope left me, and that was centered
in "Old Pap Thomas."</p>

<p class='c000'>These various headquarters that I had visited
were all situated at or near Manchester, and I
applied to them all the same day; but the headquarters
of General Thomas was at Winchester,
more than sixty miles from our camp. The
point now was how to get to Winchester? I
went to the colonel and applied for a pass for
that place, which, luckily for my purpose, he
granted me without asking me what I wanted it
for. We had a train down in the morning and
back at night; so the next morning, armed with
my pass and my badly <em>disallowed</em> application in
my pocket, I took the train for Winchester.
With my heart away up in my thorax, I approached
the headquarters of the old general.
I was compelled to wait a long time, it seemed
to me, to obtain an interview with him; he received
me very gravely, yet kindly, and carefully
listened to all I had to say; he wanted to
know "if the men would be able to go home if the
furlough should be granted?" I insisted they
would if granted immediately, and that must
be my excuse for not sending the application
through the regular channel. I urged upon the
general the fact that so many of our men were
dying in the hospitals of that terrible disease.
The old iron-faced general turned to a member
of his staff that was at a table writing and told
him to indorse the application <em>allowed</em>. I then
asked the general if he would indorse on the
same, leave for me to take it in person to General
Rosecrans. This he most cheerfully did,
and General Rosecrans issued the furloughs
without another word of explanation.</p>

<p><em>ADJUTANT SHERBURN B. EATON.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The next morning the sick boys were taken
to the train, and started for Ohio. In sixty days
two of them returned for duty, were in every
battle of the regiment, and were honorably discharged.
The other was discharged for disability.
One of them, after the war, made himself a
home in California, the other I meet often, but
I never see him but I think how much he owes
to that noble "Old Pap Thomas."</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few days after we were ordered to get
ready to march, and the first day brought us to
a beautiful mountain river, on the banks of
which we went into camp, near a small quaker
village called Irvingville, I think. The next
morning we had to ford the river, which was
cold and in some places quite deep. This
brought us to the first range of the Cumberland
mountains. Our regiment was detailed to assist
the wagon train up the steep mountain road,
which duty occupied our attention the greater
part of the day. That night we encamped on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the mountain, and enjoyed a most refreshing
sleep in the cool invigorating mountain air.
The next day we marched down off from this
ridge into the Sequatchie valley. This valley
is some mile or more, perhaps, in width and
runs down to Chattanooga, and we entered it
some six or eight miles from its head. Through
this valley runs a pure cold stream of water—a
thing always prized by an army or camping
party.</p>

<p class='c000'>We also found here plenty of corn—just at
the roasting-ear period of maturity; and it would
surprise you farmers to see how soon a ten-acre
field of green corn would be used up by an
army. But how did the boys prepare it so as
to make it good and wholesome? Of course,
it could be roasted on the ear, but that was too
slow a process. By this time, in our experience
as soldiers, we had divided into messes of about
four. One would carry a small tin pail or kettle,
holding about four quarts; another would
carry a small frying pan; the third would carry
a coffeepot (without which the rebellion could
not have been put down); while the fourth would
carry some other article necessary to the culinary
art. The commissary supplied us with salt pork
or bacon, and also with salt and pepper. Now
the culinary process is this: the corn is gathered
and carefully silked, then with a sharp knife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>(and every soldier was supposed to have one—or
if left lying about loose) the corn was shaven
from the cob, put into the frying pan with a
slice of pork or bacon, and cooked until tender;
add salt and pepper to suit taste, and you have
a dish good enough to set before a union soldier—and
too good for a king.</p>

<p class='c000'>We remained in this beautiful valley until
the corn was all used up; and one would be
surprised to see how it helped out our rations.
One other notable thing about this green-corn
diet—some of our men that were sick, but
dreaded to be sent back to hospital and had
kept along with us as best they could, were
entirely cured by this change of diet. It was
the vegetable food that did the good work for
them. I have known green apples, that are
always supposed to be harmful to a well person,
help a sick soldier.</p>

<p class='c000'>One could not help thinking, what was to
become of these poor people of this valley,
whose only means of support we had eaten up
and destroyed; but war is merciless, "war is
hell," as General Sherman said.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we broke up our camp we pushed
straight for Waldron's ridge lying directly in
front of us. We found the ascent of this ridge
much more difficult than that of the other had
been, but finally we reached the top of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>mountain. It was very singular to find here
a country with all the characteristics of level or
table-land—lying more than two thousand feet
above the country we had left behind us, or the
valley of the river beyond. The next day we
resumed the march, and in the afternoon began
the descent into the valley of the Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road down the mountain was the worst,
by far, that we had encountered. In some
places the road lay over ledges of rocks that
were four feet directly down; and many wagons
were broken, as well as axles of cannons and
caissons. I suppose, to this day, there could be
found evidences of that fearful descent, in the
wreck of government property lying along that
mountain road.</p>

<p class='c000'>The valley of the Tennessee at last reached,
we went into camp at Poe's tavern, and remained
there some three weeks, spending the
most of our time in foraging for our animals, as
well as ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this locality there is one of the greatest
curiosities it was ever my privilege to behold.
It consists of a lake or pond on the top of the
ridge we last came down. Directly to the west
of where we were encamped, the ridge breaks
off into palisades, some five hundred feet in
height. Hearing of this curious lake from some
of the natives, a party of us set out one day to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>explore it. We were compelled to go up the
ridge by the same road we had come down,
which took us some distance to the northward
of the place where we had been informed
the lake was located. At last our efforts were
rewarded by finding the place. The lake is
almost a circle of about six hundred feet in
diameter; on one side the rocks had fallen down
on an angle of about forty-five degrees, making
it possible to descend into this terrible looking
place. Once down to the water's edge one
could look up the perpendicular sides of this
walled-in lake for three hundred feet. It looks
as though at some time the rocks had sunken
down into the great cave beneath, and left this
basin which filled with water from the springs
of the mountains. One of the most curious
features of this curious basin is that the water
has a rise and fall of fifteen feet, at regular intervals.
The water was as clear as "mountain
dew," and some of our party, on going in to
swim, thought they could dive out of sight; but
no effort of a swimmer that could go down
eighteen feet, seemed to make any difference
with his visibility. The natives looked upon
this place with great awe, and gave it the fearful
name of "Devil's Washbowl."</p>

<p class='c000'>We had not been at this camp many days
before the mystery of the rising and falling of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the water in the bowl was fully explained.
About a half mile below our camp was a large
spring from which some of our brigade got
water; on going there for water one day a
soldier found the spring had failed, and so reported.
In a few days thereafter another soldier
went for water, and found the spring flowing
as bountifully as when first discovered.
An investigation showed that when the spring
ceased to flow, the water in the bowl began
to rise, and when the water in the spring began
to run, the water in the bowl began to fall.
And so it turned out to be an intermitting spring,
the philosophy of which every schoolboy that
hears me to-night is familiar; and the devil lost
the most of his reputation in that locality.</p>

<p class='c000'>We made quite a long stop at this camp, but
at last the order to march came; we went directly
down the west bank of the river for about
twenty miles, and went into camp for the night;
the next morning we marched out to the river,
and were informed that we must ford the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tennessee, where we were required to
ford it, was a little less than a mile in width,
and in some places quite swift. We were ordered
to remove our clothing, but the order
was regarded more advisory than imperative;
and while some did their clothing up in neat
bundles and bore them on their bayonets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>others kept theirs on and trusted to the
warmth of their bodies to dry them on the
other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>We started in four ranks, the usual marching
order; we got on very well until we came to
the deep and rapid portion of the river, when
some of our short men became very apprehensive,
and I remember we had to keep hold of
hands to prevent the current from carrying us
down the stream; while we had to take our
shortest men on our shoulders to keep their
heads above water. It is a sight never to be
forgotten to see a mile of men in the water.
After having gained the east bank in safety
we spent the time in watching the others come
across, or in drying our water soaked garments.
It was amusing to see the little short fellows
ford; they would come along with great bravery
until they came to the deep water, when you
could see them holding their heads away back;
now and then one would go all under, and you
would see him climbing some fellow that nature
had provided with a longer pair of running-gears;
but finally all crossed in safety, and
no sickness followed this enforced baptism.</p>

<p class='c000'>We went into camp that afternoon near the
river; and the next morning took up the march
in the direction of Ringgold, Ga. Here we
found, as a rule, the people had abandoned their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>homes and gone south, leaving them to be pillaged
by thoughtless or criminally inclined soldiers.
On this day's march I saw an instance
of the propensity of some men to steal that
was about as amusing as it was disgusting.
As I was marching at the head of my company
I heard a great clattering, and on looking back
I saw a soldier coming with a great load on his
back done up in a piece of shelter tent, which
on a nearer inspection proved to be a set of
dishes; there were tureens, bowls, plates, pitchers,
platters, and in fact everything known to
a well regulated set of dishes. The fellow
marched on with great composure amid the
derisive shouts of his comrades that he passed;
and probably that night ate his hard-tack off
southern china.</p>

<p class='c000'>That night we went into camp near a branch
of the Chickamauga river, and the next day
marched into Ringgold. This village, named
in honor of Major Ringgold, that fell at the battle
of Buena Vista, was a town of about two
thousand people at that time, I should think,
when at home, beautifully located at the foot of
the White Oak mountains; but very few of its
people remained there, and the town was a very
sorry looking place, though built mostly of
brick, and in much better taste than most of
the southern towns that we had seen.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Here I saw the first exhibition of the extreme
spitefulness of the southern woman. Our camp
was close to quite a fine looking residence, and
seeing a collection of soldiers about there, I
thought I would step over and see what was
going on. In the doorway stood a good looking,
decent appearing lady, and another was just
inside of the door. The first one spoke to the
crowd of soldiers (that looked as though calico
was worth a dollar a yard), and said, "I suppose
yuans all came down here to rob weuns of our
land." Some one denied the accusation, and,
with the most intense bitterness depicted in
every feature, she added, "Weuns are perfectly
willin' to give yuans all land 'nough to bury
yuans on, and we reckon yuans will need consid'able
befo yuans git out heyer." I am sorry
to say that some of the boys that laughed at
the display of provincialism and spite on the
part of the rebel lady, were compelled to take
up with her offer a few days thereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here we found quite a lively skirmish going
on between Wilder's mounted infantry
and some confederate cavalry, out toward
Dalton.</p>

<p class='c000'>We remained here a few days and then
moved over to the locality of Lee &amp; Gordon's
mills, and the eighteenth day of September
found us encamped on the Chickamauga
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>river, some sixteen miles south of Chattanooga.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chickamauga is a small river that puts
into the Tennessee a few miles above Chattanooga;
at most places fordable in low water,
but at some points, owing to the limestone formation,
dropping into pools, deep and cavernous.
The Indians named the little stream
Chickamauga, and as they interpret, the word
means "dead man's river;" if the name was intended
to be prophetic, how terribly was it fulfilled
the nineteenth and twentieth days of
September, 1863.</p>

<p class='c000'>All day the eighteenth the south bank of the
stream was held by the skirmish line of the
enemy; and I remember it was quite a novel
and exciting scene to witness the belching of
the smoke and flame from the muskets of the
skirmishers, while now and then the whizzing
of the stray bullet, admonished us that even off
duty our position was not one of absolute
safety and repose. All that day "the grapevine
telegraph" was working in fine shape. The camp
was alive with rumors that McCook's Corps had
not yet effected the crossing of the mountains;
that Bragg had been reinforced by Longstreet
from the army of northern Virginia (this was
true), and it was the purpose of the confederate
commander to destroy the 14th and 21st Corps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>before a junction could be made with McCook,
and before the Reserve Corps under Granger
could come within reinforcing distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun had just hid his face behind the
rocky sides of the Lookout when the order was
given to "strike tents," and each regiment was
quietly but speedily formed in marching order,
and all that night long we marched to the right,
to be nearer McCook when the time should
come when the foe, long followed and hunted,
should hunt us in return.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any one who has not had the experience cannot
have any notion of the absolutely disgusting
weariness of a night march in the presence
of the enemy. To march in column, day or
night, is much more fatiguing than to march
singly; but on this terrible night, I remember,
the dust was shoe mouth deep, and it came up
filling our nostrils with dirt and our souls with
indignation. Happy, then, was he that had some
phrases, unknown to the ordinary soldier, with
which he could give vent to his disgust. If it is
true "that hope keeps the heart from breaking,"
I have often had the reflection that "there are
moments—this was one of them," when the
strong expressions used by the union soldier
kept him from desertion. Then the halting to
let a battery of artillery pass or a train of baggage
wagons, while we were standing or being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>led into the darkness, in a kind of military
blind man's buff, without any of the merry incidents
of that childish game of the long ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last the morning of the nineteenth of September,
1863, dawned on thousands of that
grand old army for the last time. Inexperienced
as we of the 124th O. V. I. were at this
time, we knew that we should soon be struggling
in the shock and carnage of battle. That
the time for our first baptism of blood and fire
was fast approaching. The blare of the bugles
on every hand told that the work of preparation
for that struggle that was to be one that was to
save the army from annihilation, was soon to
begin.</p>

<p class='c000'>We pulled out of the old road that leads from
Lee &amp; Gordon's mills on the Chickamauga, to
Chattanooga, and halted and made coffee and
were soon partaking of "the soldier's banquet,"
not a very elaborate bill of fare, but relished by
those tired and dusty soldiers, notwithstanding
the preparations for battle going on around us.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember a little colloquy that took place
between our colonel and General Palmer that
morning, while we were breakfasting that illustrates
how lightly soldiers can talk about going
into battle, no matter how they may feel. Our
colonel said, "general, there's going to be a
dance down there this morning, is there not?"
"Yes," replied the general, "and in less than an
hour your regiment will get an invitation to attend
it."</p>

<p><em>COLOR-BEARER SERGEANT LLOYD A. MARSH.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The country where the battle was fought was
largely woods, now and then broken by what in
southern parlance is called a "deadening," which
simply means that the timber has been killed by
girdling, and the ground subjected to the mode
of cultivation of slave times in the South. Some
portions of the country are quite level, and then
breaking into bluffs, as one leaves the river
and approaches the foothills of the mountains.
Fisher Ames said, "nobody sees a battle," and
it is literally true. While Ames had reference
to the great battles of the East that were invariably
fought on open plains, how certain the
statement is when thick woods and hills intervene
along the battle line, which in this case,
extended for more than seven miles from right
to left.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon the bugle sounded the "assembly" and
our brigade commanded by the late lamented
General H. B. Hazen, filed out into the Chattanooga
road. We had not moved more than
half a mile to the left, and down the road, when
we came to an old partially cleared field and
deadening, halted, marched into this field and
formed into "double column at half distance,"
which every soldier knows is the last position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>before the line of battle is formed. Soon one
regiment after another took its place in the line,
and all was ready for the advance into the
woods in our front where we knew from the
skirmishing that had been going on all the
morning, that the enemy's line of battle was
extending itself, with the evident intention of
getting between our left and Chattanooga. As
I have before said, this battle was the first time
our regiment had been under fire, though the
other regiments of which our brigade was composed
had done good service at Perryville and
Stone river.</p>

<p class='c000'>I suppose there are plenty of men, that can
get ready, and go into a battle without fear or
wavering, but for my part, my recollection of
that momentous event, is somewhat like another's,
who describes his condition on a certain
occasion as, "whether in the body, I cannot
tell, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell;
God knoweth."</p>

<p class='c000'>But the order to move forward came at last
and we moved into the pine and oak woods in
our front. We had moved but a few yards into
the woods, when the enemy opened fire and
two of my men were wounded at the first discharge.
I was then in command of company
B 124th O. V. I., composed of my schoolmates
and scholars, the most of them farmers' sons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>that knew the use of the rifle; and but very few
but that had a larger share of <em>courage</em> than their
commanding officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was ordered to deploy my company, as
skirmishers to cover the regiment, and moved
to the front. This movement was executed
under fire and not in very good style. The
regimental bugle still sounded the <em>forward</em>,
until my skirmish line was within three hundred
feet of the confederate line of battle. My
line now attracted the attention of the enemy,
and drew his fire exclusively. A six gun battery
was run up to the line, and in less time
than I can now tell it, my farmer boys had shot
down every horse and not one of the gunners
could approach a gun.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time I saw the first man of our regiment
killed, Corporal Atkins. He was a tall,
finely formed man, a farmer and school-teacher
by occupation; an abolitionist, he hated slavery,
and consequently the slaveholders' rebellion; and
many a time around the mirthful campfire had
he been the object of the friendly raillery of his
comrades, by reason of his fiery sentiments of
hatred of that giant wrong; and sometimes it
was hinted in his hearing, "the best fighters
are not as a rule, the best talkers." I can see
him now as he stands at my right behind the
sheltering trunk of a large pine loading and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>firing, in that storm of bullets, as calmly as
though not at death's carnival. I see the blood
flowing from his left shoulder, I say, "William,
you are badly wounded; go to the rear." Putting
his hand up to his wounded shoulder, and
extending his left arm says, "see captain, I am
not much hurt, I want to give them another."
He draws another cartridge from his box,
springs his rammer, runs the cartridge half
down—a bullet from the enemy pierces that
brave heart, and I see him fall on his face—dead.
So perished one of those brave sons
that fought <em>for a great principle</em>, which was the
soul of the union army. By the fortunes of the
field, we were compelled to leave him there
"unknelled, uncoffined and unknown," buried,
if at all, by the careless enemy. But if there is
a future where the deeds of the brave and true
are rewarded, William Atkins will be one of the
brightest stars in the galaxy of immortal life.
But I must hasten with my story or I weary
you, as that day wearied us.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skirmish line alone of our regiment was
engaged. The line of battle could not fire for
fear of injury to our line, while our line was so
far advanced that the enemy's fire enfiladed us;
trees, the ordinary cover of skirmishers, were no
protection whatever. Our colonel ordered us
to lie down and our main line opened fire over
us, and it was difficult to tell from which we
suffered most, the fire of the enemy, or the bad
marksmanship of the line in the rear. Finally,
those of us that had not been killed and
wounded, fell back on the line of battle and
fought with that line, and thus the day wore
away.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>In the afternoon, sometime, the order was
sent around to be saving of our ammunition as
no more could be had at present, and if the
confederates charged we must rely upon the
bayonet.</p>

<p class='c000'>About four o'clock in the afternoon, we heard
the commands of officers in our rear, and turning
in that direction, we saw the blue of our
lines over the old field coming to our relief. It
was General Johnson's division of McCook's
Corps. They are formed in column by regimental
front, at a distance of about two hundred
yards between regiments. The first regiment
at double-quick rushes through and past
our broken and decimated ranks, not stopping
until they come close to the confederate line;
then halting abruptly, deliver a well directed
volley in the face of the enemy, fall and reload,
while the next regiment rushes over them only
to repeat what those had done who had gone
before. It would be almost idle to add that
the confederates were compelled to fall back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>though composed of the flower of the army of
northern Virginia. No men no matter how
brave, could stand outside of works the deadly
impetuosity of such a charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had seen many noble looking men before;
I have seen many since, but have never seen any
such men in appearance, as composed that
charging column that relieved us that dismal
afternoon at Chickamauga. Had every division
of the Army of the Cumberland been handled
and fought as General Johnson's division was
that afternoon, the historian would write Chickamauga
a victory, instead of a defeat.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this charge, in which General Johnson
drove Longstreet's line back to and across the
river nearly a mile and a half from where we
had engaged him, we had time to look after our
wounded men. I received permission to go out
to the place where we had fought on the skirmish
line. Seeing that all the wounded men were
carefully removed to the rear, I hastened back
to join my company. If I was filled with terror
on going into the battle, I was doubly so now.
To be lost from one's command in time of
action is hard to explain, and a situation for
which, among soldiers, there is ever exercised
very little charity. I inquired of some wounded
men the direction my regiment had taken, and
hurrying on, fear lending wings to speed, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>halted near a log cabin in a small opening
where a six gun battery stood, and to the guns
of which the men were attaching long ropes
known as prolongs. I soon came upon my
company and regiment lying flat on the ground,
and evidently waiting orders. I took my position
in the company, thankful that the regiment
had not been engaged in my absence. In our
immediate front all was still. The ground
ascended in a gentle elevation, thickly covered
with brush but here and there a tree. All at
once there arose one of those terrible yells that
only a mass of rebels could produce, and on
looking to the front, I saw coming down the hill
a solid mass of confederate infantry; their stars
and bars flaunting gaily, as the color-bearers
came dancing on. All at once the right of our
line began falling back without firing a shot,
until all had commenced retiring to the right of
our company. I was chagrined at what seemed
an ignoble retreat, leaving the battery I had
passed to certain capture. The rebels had began
firing, but seemed to fire far above us, as
the leaves and small branches of the trees fell
thickly about us. As they came nearer, their
marksmanship seemed to improve, and several
of my men were wounded, among the number
was Lieutenant Charles M. Stedman, who,
though badly wounded in the shoulder, refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to leave the company until the battle was over.
He afterward laid his young life on the altar of
his country at the battle of New Hope Church,
May 27th, 1864. He was one of the very few
<em>absolutely</em> brave men, I ever knew. I turned to
watch the advancing rebel hosts and to see
what would become of the battery when their
six guns opened one after another in rapid succession,
and I saw lanes and alleys open in
the solid ranks of confederate gray. This
was repeated as rapidly as the guns could be
worked and never an over-charged thundercloud
seemed to strike more rapidly, than that
grand old United States battery poured its
double-shotted canisters at half distance into
the now panic-stricken and flying rebel horde.</p>

<p class='c000'>A lone battery with no infantry support on its
left, with the infantry support on its right, for, to
me, some unaccountable reason, retreating without
firing a shot, fighting and repelling an
entire brigade of confederate infantry. I never
saw it repeated. I never heard of its being
repeated in all of my experience in the war,
thereafter. I don't know what battery it was,
I never could find out with any certainty, but
better work was never done by any of those
brave men that worship their brazen guns more
than did ever heathen devotee the molten image
he calls his God.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>I saw Colonel Beebe of General Hazen's staff
after this eventful day, and he informed me that
his duties called him over this portion of the
field, and it was with difficulty he rode his horse
among the dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not thicker do lie the ripened sheaves in the harvest
field, where nature has been most generous,
than did the confederate dead on that lone hillside.</p>

<p class='c000'>That night we marched to a new position
and went into bivouac in line of battle. The
night was cold and frosty, and as we were not
permitted to have much fire and had left our
knapsacks behind, we suffered from the cold;
but "tired nature's sweet restorer" overcame all
difficulties, and we lay down and slept among
the dead as sweetly as though we had been bidden
"good-night" in our own northern homes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus ended the nineteenth day of September,
1863, and something of what I recollect of the
campaign of Chattanooga and the first day's
battle of Chickamauga.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sunday morning, September 20th, dawned
cold and cheerless on the waiting armies. The
line had been reformed in the following order:</p>

<p class='c000'>The 14th Corps occupied the extreme left, then
came our corps, the 21st, with McCook on the
right and the Reserve Corps not yet up. All
felt that this Sabbath day would decide the fate
of the army, as well as determine the result of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the campaign, for good or ill, to the cause of
the Union. Early in the morning we were
ordered to construct such works along our line
as the material at hand would admit of, for at
that time in the war we had not learned the
value of the pick and shovel. It is wonderful
what men can do when in extremity, or when
their own safety or that of the cause for which
they battle, requires the exercise of ingenuity or
industry. Soon old logs, fence rails and everything
else that could stop a bullet, were being
brought to the line. And by eight o'clock a
line of works was constructed that, while not
any defense against artillery, furnished quite a
sufficient protection against small arms. My
company was again ordered out as skirmishers
into the woods in front of the brigade. We had
not been on the line more than an hour when
the rebels advanced their line of skirmishers,
and the firing began.</p>

<p class='c000'>My orders were to keep the line well out, and
to retire only on the line of battle when the
enemy advanced in force. It was soon evident
to all that the rebels designed to force the fighting
for we could see his charging lines rapidly
advancing. We then fell back to our line of
log and rail works, and in doing so had to run
the gauntlet of the fire of excitable men of our
line that could not be controlled.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Once over the works, and in position in the
line, we had not long to wait for the onset. The
eagerness of the enemy in following the skirmishers
soon brought them into rifle range. Our
Colonel Payne had been very severely wounded
early the day before, and the command of the
regiment devolved upon Major James B. Hampson,
who afterwards gave his life to his country
at Dallas, Ga. With the coolness and bearing
of an old veteran he ordered our regiment
to hold its fire until the rebels were within close
range of our works, then, all at once, we arose
and poured a well-aimed volley into their ranks.
The 41st O. V. I., directly in our rear and forming
a second line, then gave them a volley and
their charge was ended. Three times that morning
the enemy charged our position, only to be
beaten back in disorder and confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time occurred that terrible mistake
in the battle that caused the panic and rout of a
portion of McCook's Corps, and which carried
our commanding general out of the fight and
back to Chattanooga, leaving General Thomas to
fight the battle alone. It was here that General
Thomas received the title of the "Rock of
Chickamauga;" and it was from this field that
General Rosecrans was retired—never to be
heard from again during the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>About eleven o'clock a. m. the confederates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>commenced a most determined onset on the
14th Corps at our left. It soon became evident
that the enemy was gaining ground, as the firing
came nearer and nearer, and the left kept falling
back until the cannon shot from the enemy cut
the limbs from the trees above us, and we expected
every moment to hear the order "change
front to rear." The corps to our left had fallen
back to nearly at right angles with our line, and
we could plainly see the wounded men being
borne back or slowly straggling to the rear.
There are times in the life of almost anyone
when the circumstances with which he is surrounded
are burned into his memory as though
graven with a pen of fire. So on this occasion,
although the enemy had been badly beaten in
our front, we saw our line of battle momentarily
crumbling away on our left. Visions of Libby,
Salisbury and Andersonville came before us,
and it did seem as though our fate was destruction
or captivity. While intensely watching
the progress of the battle on our left, all at
once we saw the front of a column of men coming
on the double-quick out of the woods in our
rear. They advance nearly up to our position,
they halt, and face to the left. We saw an officer
on a white horse ride up to a color bearer. He
takes the standard out of his hand, and with the
grand old stars and stripes in one hand, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>sword in the other, he gallops to the front; the
ranks of blue follow fast their intrepid leader.
Then was battle on in all the grandeur of its
pomp and circumstance. No one single musket
could be heard, but as some vast storm that
comes sweeping on from the northwest with a
roar that is appallingly sublime, mingled the volleys
of the contending hosts, while the salvos of
the artillery cause the earth to tremble as in the
throes of an earthquake. Our line swings back,
like a gate on its hinges, to its former position.
But where is that glorious spirit that led that
gallant charge that has saved us from capture
and our army from certain defeat? An orderly
is seen leading back the white horse "that carried
his master into the fray," but no rider is
there. "Wounded, but not mortally" is the
word that is passed from lip to lip. And that
brave Polish officer, General Turchin, still lives
to receive the thanks and honors of his adopted
countrymen. This was the same officer that
rebelled against the old world tyranny and, in
1848, with Sigel, Willich, Schurz, Austerhause
and many others, fought for liberty in the fatherland
until fighting was hopeless; and for the
liberty they could never win in their country
came to ours; but, strange to say, not one of
them ever drew his sword in the cause of the
slaveholder's rebellion. Very many of them, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>some one has truly said, "wrote their naturalization
papers in their blood."</p>

<p class='c000'>About two o'clock p. m. our brigade was
relieved from the line where we had fought
in the morning, and held in reserve, ready to
be taken to any point on the line where our
services might be most needed. The enemy, by
the mistake that I have referred to before, had
driven a portion of McCook's Corps from the
field and entirely out of the battle, and had
extended its left so far to the rear as to cut us
off from a large spring that had furnished us
with water the day before. From the time of
this calamity in the morning we had no water,
and the air was thick with the sulphurous smoke
that created an intense thirst. The men were
clamoring and insisting that someone should
go for water. There was one member of our
company, George Benton, that by his kindness
of heart, and implicit and cheerful obedience to
orders, had won the respect and confidence of
his officers and the hearts of his fellow soldiers.
In speech, modest and kindly, yet in the battle
he had shown himself as brave as the bravest.
George came to me loaded down with canteens,
and asked permission to go to the rear and try
to find water. I, with some emphasis, refused.
The men at that set up a clamor, and insisted
that they were suffering for want of water. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>explained the hazardous nature of the enterprise.
I assured them from the firing that our
right was well turned, and that anyone going
back, alone and unattended, was liable to
be killed, wounded, or <em>captured</em>, which all
dreaded more than death or wounds by reason
of the inhuman treatment our soldiers received
while in rebel prisons. I said to George,
"I am afraid you will never come back." With
a smile of determination lighting up that noble
young face, he replied, "I will come back, captain,
or I will be a dead Benton." I was not
quite strong enough for the emergency. I made
a mistake. That mistake cost George Benton
his life. He never returned. Whether he fell
by a stray bullet, in those deep woods and
thickets, or whether he was captured and murdered
in prison, I know not. The records of
Salisbury and Andersonville were searched,
after the war, but on none could the name of
George Benton be found. After we had fallen
back on Chattanooga letters came from his
father and sisters, inquiring concerning the fate
of son and brother. No one can know with
what bitterness I reproached myself for allowing
myself to be persuaded against my better
judgment; and learning by that sad lesson—no
member of company B was ever again reported
"missing in action." I saw the father and sisters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>when we came back from the war, and told
them what I had already written them before of
the way George was lost; but "hope, like an
anchor to the soul, sure and steadfast," would
not suffer them to give up their dear boy as
lost. They hoped that some day, like a lost
mariner, he would come from perhaps captivity
and sickness, to gladden their hearts and relieve
the suspense that was crushing their lives. But
twenty-seven autumns have returned since that
brave boy was lost to sight in the smoke that
covered that dread field of Chickamauga, but no
tidings ever came of that one, who was gladly
willing to risk his life to alleviate the sufferings
of his comrades, and was permitted to do so by
the weakness of his commanding officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about four o'clock p. m. our attention was
drawn to the heavy firing on our extreme right,
and we conjectured that our Reserve Corps was
being brought into action. It proved to be true.
General Granger came up and with his corps
that had known but little, if anything, of the disasters
of the day, charged the enemy with the
force and effect of victors.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it seemed it was not the purpose of General
Thomas to contend for the field of battle,
and to General Granger's Corps was assigned
the duty of covering the retreat of the balance
of the army.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>It was Wellington (whom his comrades loved
to call the "Iron Duke") that said at the battle
of Waterloo, "would that sundown or Blücher
had come." And never did sundown hang his
somber curtain over a more grateful body of
men than those that remained of the Army of
the Cumberland. Just as the sun began to cast
the long shadows to the eastward our brigade
was retired to the west for about half a mile,
still in order of battle; but any one could discern
that a general retreat was to be commenced as
soon as the friendly darkness should cover us
from the view of the enemy. While in this
position we heard cheers from what seemed to
be a great body of men, and the rumor was at
once out that General Burnside had reinforced
us from Knoxville. We answered the cheers
as heartily as our tired bodies and depressed
spirits would permit, and the sky was ablaze
with the rockets that shot up from the direction
from which we had heard the cheering. Mendenhall's
battery of Rodman guns was at that
time just in our front. He ordered his men to
load with canister, and then I heard him remark
"that is the last round of ammunition this
battery has."</p>

<p class='c000'>Some one out toward the skirmish line heard
the order "Ninth Louisiana, forward, double-quick,
march," and pretty effectually dispelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the delusion that the cheering and rocket party
were our friends under General Burnside. It
was now quite dark, and tired, depressed and
supperless, we commenced the march that meant
that the battlefield, with all its treasures of our
dead heroes, was to be abandoned to the tender
mercies of an enemy that looked upon us as
invaders and destroyers of their rights and liberties.
It was, indeed, a sad hour. Two days
before we had gone into this conflict with full
ranks and high hopes of victory. Now we were
"silently stealing away" under cover of the
darkness, like dastardly assassins, when, in fact,
we were there in the holy cause of liberty for all
men, and for the union of the states as against
rebellion and treason. We were leaving our
beloved dead, uncomposed, unburied, with nothing
to mark the spot where they fell, with no
place of sepulture, with no requiem, save the
soughing of the south wind through the banners
of the majestic pines, or the nightly songs of the
sweet voiced southern mocking bird.</p>

      <div class='line'>But we left them alone in their glory."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We drew away into the defiles of the hills,
and the glad sound of the splashing of the
horses' hoofs in the little streams that trickled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>from the hillsides, then the scraping of the tin
cups could be heard (the efforts of the boys to
get a drink of the muddy hoof-trodden water);
but straining it through the teeth, no nectar
quaffed by the fabled gods of old ever tasted so
refreshing as did that grand beverage of nature
to those battle-stained soldiers that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the route we marched that night I never
had the least information; but when the sun
arose over the mountains of North Carolina, the
twenty-first day of September, it looked down
upon the old army in order of battle on the
summit of Missionary Ridge. All day we kept
this position, but the confederates wanted no
more fighting on this occasion, and, you can believe
me, <em>they had my entire sympathies</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some have said that both armies retreated
from the field of battle, and had our army stayed
on the field the night of the twentieth, no
confederate army would have confronted it on
the morning of the twenty-first. But this story,
though I am told it has gone into history, I
never believed to be true. In the first place, the
confederate general, Bragg, had, when the campaign
commenced, an army nearly equal in
numbers to our own, with no rear to take care
of and guard. Secondly, after he crossed the
mountains he was reinforced by General Longstreet's
Corps from the army of northern Virginia.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>And, thirdly, he had at his command
(but not called into the battle to any extent) a
large force of Georgia state militia.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then again, the second day of the battle McCook's
Corps was largely cut to pieces and destroyed
for fighting business. The 14th and
21st Corps were badly cut up in the two days
fighting, and at the close of the second day almost
destitute of ammunition. And finally, there
was the movement of men before sundown to
inform that <em>we</em> were abandoning the field. So
it never seemed credible that the confederates
were retreating the night of the twentieth as
well as ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night of the twenty-first we fell back and
entrenched a position just outside of the then
small village of Chattanooga. The victorious
confederates occupied the whole extent of Missionary
Ridge, and soon appeared in force on
the summit of Lookout.</p>

<p class='c000'>So I have given you, in great weakness and
imperfection, some of my recollections of the
memorable campaign of Chattanooga and the
battle of Chickamauga. I have read no book or
history giving an account of the campaign and
battle. Being simply an officer in the line my
chances for observation were very limited, and
very many of my conclusions are, <em>without doubt,
inaccurate</em>. The plans of a battle, always an
interesting feature of history, I have, as a matter
of course, been compelled to omit.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE SIEGE OF CHATTANOOGA, THE BATTLE OF LOOKOUT<br /> MOUNTAIN, AND THE STORMING OF<br /> MISSIONARY RIDGE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The battle of the nineteenth and twentieth of
September, 1863, had resulted in disaster instead
of victory. The Army of the Cumberland had
been forced to retire, to abandon Missionary
Ridge, and to fortify a line running through the
outskirts of the village of Chattanooga from
Cameron Hill, near the river below to the river
above.</p>

<p class='c000'>The victorious rebels came on and took possession
of the entire length of Missionary Ridge,
fortifying the same with strong parapets of
earth, while one hundred pieces of artillery soon
found position on the Ridge from right to left.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Bragg also took possession of Lookout
mountain, and planted some very heavy
guns near the summit, just above the palisades.
I never knew why those guns did not render
our position around Chattanooga entirely untenable,
unless it was the poor quality of the
guns or lack of ammunition. All the execution
that I ever heard of those guns doing was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>kill a mule that would have died of starvation
later on. Those hundred-pounders that were
planted on the summit of Lookout were, for
some reason, only fired a few times, and not for
weeks prior to the time the siege was raised.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never in the history of the Army of the Cumberland
had the spirit of its officers and men
been more depressed. The battle of Chickamauga
had not only been fought and lost, but
we also lost what was more than losing a battle.
We had lost confidence in our commander.</p>

<p class='c000'>And I think when the order came relieving
General Rosecrans and placing General Grant
in command of the Army of the Cumberland,
there were few regrets expressed, even among
those that had theretofore given General Rosecrans
the title of "Hero of Stone River." But,
in my humble judgment, one thing, and one
thing only, saved the Army of the Cumberland.
If General Rosecrans had shown himself incompetent
to command the army at the battle of
Chickamauga, the rebel general, Bragg, was
possessed of a stupidity that more than overbalanced
the incompetency of Rosecrans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just for one moment view our situation. Almost
surrounded. No railroad communications
over which to supply rations or ammunition.
No transportation whatever, save one wagon
road over Raccoon mountain, and that so exposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>in places to the rebel sharpshooters that
the teamsters (though in a sense noncombatants)
were constantly exposed to the fire of an
enemy they could neither see nor reply to.
Then the road itself was simply horrible. When
not bounding over ledges of rocks that nothing
but an army wagon could withstand, they mired
in the quicksand holes with which the way
abounded, so that at times an empty wagon
was more than a load for a six mule team.
Then, this only road was constantly exposed
to the raids of troops of the rebel mounted
infantry. It was of this road a story is told
of a teamster that was stuck with a load of ammunition
in one of those miry places, and while
he was waking the mountain echoes with his
black whip and profanity, was overtaken by an
"army chaplain," just fresh from some theological
seminary of the north, and had not made the
acquaintance of the army mule driver. Hearing
the terrible profanity of this Jehu stuck fast in
the mud, thought this a fitting opportunity to
"sow the good seed," and riding up to the disgusted
M. D. said, "My friend, do you know
that Christ died for sinners?" The M. D., with
a glance at the new and dazzling uniform of
the chaplain, sang out, "Look a yer stranger, do
you think it's any time for conundrums when
I'm stuck fast in the mud and the rebels not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>quarter of a mile in the rear?" Whether the
chaplain thought his "ground was stony," or
that the rebels were too near, he abandoned
his theological lesson and left the M. D. to
his fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this situation of transportation, with no
country on which to forage or draw any supplies
whatever, with the Tennessee river behind
us, with the Cumberland mountains beyond the
river, with more than two hundred miles from
the nearest reinforcements, what but the stupidity
of Bragg saved us from destruction while
in that position.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, instead of striking us while depressed by
defeat, he suffered us to select our position, and
before ten days had elapsed our line was bristling
with forts of no mean dimensions and
strength, putting our capture beyond the possibility
of being accomplished by assault.</p>

<p class='c000'>The siege of Chattanooga proper began about
the twenty-fifth of September. It was not long
after this before a flag of truce was sent to General
Bragg's headquarters on Missionary Ridge,
asking the privilege of going out to the Chickamauga
battlefield to bury our dead. It had
been so slightly done that in some instances
not enough dirt had been thrown over the sleeping
braves to cover their uniforms. This last
sad office was tenderly and carefully performed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>and in all instances where there was anything
to identify the dead soldier, his name, company,
and regiment were marked on rude headboards
that could be improvised on the spot. But alas!
the fact that we, as an army, could not collect
our dead after the battle, caused thousands to
sleep in nameless graves.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the war this army of known and unknown
dead was carefully removed to the National
Cemetery at Orchard Knob, near the base
of the ridge, and buried; all the <em>known</em> neatly
marked; but how frequently the word <em>unknown</em>
occurs in that beautiful home of the
dead soldier.</p>

<p class='c000'>One good result, besides the decent interment
of our dead, was the fact that all of our wounded
that were not able to be removed to southern
prisons were paroled and sent into Chattanooga.
One of our men, Arthur Budlong, had lain
upon the battlefield until our boys found him
and brought him in under the flag of truce.
Thus were the severities of war somewhat
modified by the humanity of man that not even
the unseemly war-cloud could altogether overshadow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The monotony and dreariness of a siege can
be appreciated only by those that have taken
part therein. Language fails me to give you
anything like an adequate idea of its listless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>torments. While on the march the scenery is
constantly changing. The exercise of marching
keeps one healthy, and keeps one's mind employed
and the banishment from home and
loved ones does not occupy so much of one's
thoughts. The skirmishing and fighting, while
dreadful in consequences and results, has on the
soldier, to a certain extent, an exhilarating effect;
and the hours spent thereafter, in the tales
of personal adventure and experience, while
causing one sometimes to think that the tribe
of "Ananias" was not extinct, yet these tales
of personal valor and daring helped to cheer
and while away many an idle hour; and, as a
rule, no one was deceived "by the tales they
told us there." But in the siege every day was
like all the others; and from the time we fell back
on Chattanooga until operations began about
the twentieth of November, the sky was cloudless.
And while the long Indian summer period
of southern Tennessee, so delightful to the
citizen in time of peace, to us soldiers (to a certain
extent in captivity) it seemed to breed
melancholy and homesickness. We did all we
could to avert this trouble. We played seven-up
until we almost wore the spots off the cards.
We smoked and "jawed." We criticised the
plans of campaigns and battles. We decided
the merits of brigadier and major generals until,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>could you have heard us, you would have
thought we were writers formulating articles for
the Century Magazine instead of besieged soldiers
trying to drive away <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enui</span>. Oh, if baseball
had been invented then what regimental, brigade
and division clubs we could have organized,
with hospitals handy to care for the
wounded. If we had only known the silly but
fascinating game of lawn tennis our sick list
would have been shortened.</p>

<p class='c000'>But these were not all of our troubles. Our
commissary department began to get hard up
and threatened suspension. Now, for the purpose
of being understood by the Sons of Veterans
and the young people that hear me, suffer
me to explain. A <em>ration</em> is an allowance, issued
by the commissary department, of the various
things on which soldiers are fed, to-wit: hard
bread (called hard-tack), bacon (sometimes called
sow-belly), fresh beef, beans, rice, coffee, sugar,
salt and pepper, and sometimes, under favorable
circumstances, soft bread. Now a full ration is
ample for three meals, and sometimes a little to
spare when <em>full</em>. We had not been in a state of
siege long (owing to the defective transportation
of which I have spoken) before we were put
on half rations, that is, one-half of three meals or
one and one-half meals a day; and before many
days after we were put on quarter rations, that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>three-fourths of one meal a day. Now any of
you that have tried to live on less than enough
for one meal a day (and are no relation to Dr.
Tanner) will realize the situation we were in.
While our rations were short and, in fact, fast
growing less, the health of the men was materially
impaired. The truth is, as a rule, while in
camp soldiers eat too much, and exercise too
little. The quarter rations were helped out by
stealing corn from the famishing mules, which
the soldiers parched and ate. The mules and
horses that were not sent to the rear died of
starvation, so that, at the time the operations
began against the position of the enemy, we
had not a horse to move a gun. Could we have
moved our light batteries on to the Ridge, immediately
after the assault, the loss to the enemy
would have been much more severe. But
while the starvation, the enforced fast that we
suffered, may have been beneficial to the health
of the men, their morals seemed to decrease in
a corresponding ratio. Stealing whatever one
could get his hands on to eat became not only
prevalent, but popular. The brigade commissaries
had to be guarded to keep them from
being plundered, while not infrequently the
guards proved to be simply cappers for the
hungry thieves of the regiments from which
they were respectively detailed. Officer's mess-chests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>were raided; and one could not get up
in the night without seeing some adventurous
fellow slipping through the rows of tents with a
box of hard-tack on his shoulders. Holes were
excavated under the floors of the tents, and
used as storing places for the plunder obtained
by these nocturnal adventures. I now distinctly
remember one "Israelite, in whom there was no
guile," of company I, that the boys for short
called "Jew Jake," that more than kept his mess
in hard bread during that time of scarcity. But
the sad part of the whole business was that,
while the raiders and plunderers had all and
more than they needed in the way of bread, the
honest ones had comparatively less, as the commissary
department distributed with absolute
fairness the scanty rations it had to issue. And
for once there was no favoritism shown to the
officers. An officer could not buy more than was
issued for a ration to a private soldier. But I
am, as I remember it from this great lapse of
time, in no situation to be very hard upon those
volunteer commissary sergeants that were so
willing to help issue rations, even if they had to
go on night duty, for, as I now remember it, Jew
Jake was a great friend to the mess of which I
was a member. And when the time was that
the new white hard-tack looked brighter and
better than silver dollars to a people's party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>man, no questions were asked as to how they
were issued.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the day of our deliverance was fast approaching.
Above the village and on the river,
inside of our lines, was an old steam sawmill
that probably had not turned a wheel since the
war began. This was discovered by some one,
put in order by some soldier (for we had plenty
of soldiers in our ranks that could repair and
put in running order, anything from a watch to
a locomotive), and, on taking a stroll in that direction
one day, I saw a gang of soldiers sawing
two-inch planks. These planks were slipped
into the river, and landed further down town
for further use in the great drama that we were
preparing to enact. We had not been penned
up long in Chattanooga before the country became
aroused at the danger to the Army of the
Cumberland. Luckily for us almost everyone
saw our danger save General Bragg, and he
seemed to have no hostile designs on our army.
Truly, it seems to me, General Bragg was the
General McClellan of the confederate army, without
McClellan's powers of organization and his
delight in grand reviews.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I have stated before, the authorities superseded
General Rosecrans, and put the Army of
the Cumberland, and all other forces to be assembled,
in command of the "Hero of Vicksburg,"
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>"the silent conqueror of rebel armies and
strongholds." But that was not all; the government,
by the aid of the matchless executive
ability of Edwin M. Stanton, President Lincoln's
war secretary, withdrew the 20th Corps, commanded
by General Joe Hooker, from the Army
of the Potomac, transferred them by rail and put
them into camp at Bridgeport, on the Tennessee
river about fifty miles below Chattanooga, in
seven days' time. This was the most rapid movement
of troops ever known in the world's history.
In the meantime General Sherman with his western
veterans was on the long march from the
Mississippi, headed for Chattanooga. I remember
one night the rumor came by "the grapevine
telegraph," "Hooker was at Bridgeport,
Ala.," and soon the shout "Hooker has come—Hooker
has come—Hooker's at Bridgeport"
ran along our lines. Even the never ending
seven-up was abandoned, and the men gathered
in squads to inquire and discuss our prospectively
bettered condition and situation, while the
officers hastened to headquarters, anxious to
have the rumor confirmed. It was not long before
an officer from the 20th Corps was seen in
Chattanooga, and then the enthusiasm of the
Army of the Cumberland knew no bounds.
But Lookout valley was in the possession of
the enemy, and it was the purpose of General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Grant to lodge General Hooker's Corps in that
valley, preparatory to swinging it around the
north side of Lookout mountain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Day after day the sound of the ax and the
hammer might have been heard at the steamboat
landing in front of the village. It was the
building of boats from the material sawed at the
mill above. The boats were constructed on the
pontoon pattern, not deep, but wide, and if the
rebels took notice of the work they would have
been justified in believing from appearances,
that our intention was to construct a pontoon
bridge across the river from Chattanooga. But
that was not the intention. One day there
came an order from General Hazen, who commanded
our brigade, to furnish so many men,
picked men, on account of their known bravery
and soldierly character. Also, a certain number
of officers to be selected for the same qualities.
We furnished the requisite number from company
B, and so did each company of the regiment,
but the name of your unworthy speaker
was not on the list of officers. He was not
either among those <em>called</em> or <em>chosen</em>. Of course,
I did not know that our gallant Colonel Pickands
considered me worthy for the expedition
at hand; but I did know that my saber had
been hanging idly in his tent "for low, these
many days," and being there duty was not for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>me until I was again put in possession of the
same. So I stayed in camp with Captain
Powell of company G and some other officers
and men; because, while all were brave enough,
all could not be chosen. I think the number
selected from our brigade was three hundred,
commanded by that prince among fine officers,
the late lamented General Hazen.</p>

<p class='c000'>That night the detail were all gotten ready
and down to the landing; and at midnight,
when the young moon had hidden its bright
crescent behind the Cumberlands, and the fog
from the river had wrapped the base of old
Lookout in an impenetrable cloud of mist, the
"three hundred" embarked silently, and the
current of the river bore them down to the
point where the work was to be done. They
swept along without accident; and not even the
sleepless rebel pickets, that lined the left bank
of the river, discovered their presence. Just before
the sun began to chase away the darkness
from the east they halted at Brown's Ferry, the
place of their destination. Their boats were
hastily shoved ashore and the skirmish line
formed, and before the rebels in Lookout valley
knew what was going forward, the "three hundred"
of our brigade awoke them from their
dreams by the crack of their muskets, as they
scattered the rebel picket line posted along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>river, and before the sun was up Hooker's
legions were pouring into the valley and on
their way to the north base of Lookout, and by
the time the sun had set that day Hooker's
skirmish line was in sight of Chattanooga.</p>

<p class='c000'>This signal success at Brown's Ferry, more
remarkable for the boldness of its plan and the
daring with which it was executed than anything
else, did not cost our brigade the loss of a man,
either killed or wounded, but it gave Hooker a
foothold in Lookout valley whereby he swept it
of rebels and opened up <em>our cracker line</em>, as the
boys called it, and in a few days we had full
supply. From the date of the expedition to
Brown's Ferry whatever there was of the siege
of Chattanooga was raised.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Not many days after the capture of Lookout
valley by Hooker the head column of General
Sherman's troops came up on the west
side of the river and commenced laying a
pontoon bridge across, and soon the western
boys, all dusty and begrimed by their long
march, came filing through our camps. To say
they received a hearty welcome from the Army
of the Cumberland is drawing it mildly. They
were no <em>paper collar soldiers</em>. They not only
had the bearing of veterans, but victors. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>marched out east of town and went into camp
near Tunnel hill. Even soldiers often have but
little idea of the time it takes to move a great
army of men from one position to another. It
consumed an entire day for General Sherman's
army to pass out to their camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twenty-third day of November, 1863, the
Army of the Cumberland moved out late in the
afternoon, none of us knowing the purpose. We
formed in a continuous line of battle with a
heavy skirmish line well in the front. At the
word of command we all moved in the direction
of the ridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the rebels seemed to be aware of what
was intended we had come up to our picket
line, and that also advanced with our skirmishers,
when the rebel outposts in most places gave
way without showing much resistance. But
where the rebel line crossed Orchard Knob they
had quite respectable rifle pits which they defended
with some spirit, causing the 41st O. V.
I. some trouble in dislodging them, and thereby
we had some few men wounded in our brigade.
This line, formerly occupied by the rebel outposts,
we at once commenced fortifying by
throwing up strong rifle pits of earth and stone.
We then advanced our skirmish line well out
toward the base of the ridge. One of the prisoners
that we captured said: "Weuns thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>youns was coming out for a review, we didn't
think youns was coming out to fight weuns."
We informed the Johnny that General Grant was
commanding us, and he was not a review general.
That night we bivouacked on the line,
working on the rifle pits by details. It might
be well enough to here remark that the saber of
the subscriber, that had so long hung in the tent
of Colonel Pickands, was shortly before this forward
movement returned, owing to the fact that
the little unpleasantness that had occurred with
General Willich had fallen into the condition of
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">inoxous disuetude</span>," and your humble servant
was permitted to carry that then and now totally
useless appendage of an officer until the muster-out
man relieved him therefrom.</p>

<p class='c000'>For fear some of you may think my offense
was more serious than it was, and that all may
know just how severe army discipline was in
those times when men for the good of their country
submitted to the petty tyranny and whims of
their superiors, I have concluded to relate the
experience I had of being under arrest. It was
one of those beautiful Indian summer days
when, under conditions of peace, bare existence
is a luxury, I had command of the reserve post
in front of Fort Wood. To relieve the tedium
of the hour, myself and three non-commissioned
officers on duty with me were engaged in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span><em>army orthodox</em> game of "seven-up." On looking
to the eastward I saw a general officer and
his staff approaching as they came over the top
of a hill. I immediately turned out the reserve,
and when the cavalcade rode up I gave the
order "present arms," which was obeyed in
good style, but instead of General Willich and
his staff riding away with a kind good morning,
he said, "Captain, you report mit your Colonel
under arrest," and without telling me what the
"head and front of my offending" consisted of,
I started back to the headquarters of my regiment.
I deposited my <em>cheese knife</em> with the
Colonel, and he directed me to report to the
brigade commander, and he directed me to
report to General Willich, whom I found in an
old log house. I made known to him my business.
After producing a snuffbox as large as
an army frying pan, and after filling very well
his nasal appendage, commenced in about this
style: "Cap'n, you blay cards mit your men.
<em>I blay cards.</em> I blay cards mit officers, but not
mit men. You blay cards mit your men—mit
your enlisted men. Your men not have respect
mit you. Then when you come mit the battle,
you lose control mit your men, you company
preaks, the regiment preaks, and the brigade
goes to the tyfle. You go mit your quarters, I
prefer charges mit you." Here was a splendid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Prussian officer that at this late period of the
war had not learned the value of the volunteer
soldier and that it was perfectly safe to treat
him when off duty like any other gentleman of
equal merit. This fact was known in our regiment
from the start, and the difference between
the officer and the enlisted man was never
asserted only for the purpose of duty—the good
of the service. The charges of the brave Prussian
officer were preferred in due time, and, before
this movement that I have described, were
withdrawn at the instance of General Wm. B.
Hazen, and that was the last that was ever
heard of the charges of "blaying cards mit
your men."</p>

<p class='c000'>November 24th the mist hung heavy on the
summit of Lookout and almost hid the monarch
of the Cumberlands from our view. Nothing
occurred to break the monotony of the soldier's
life until about half past ten o'clock a. m. a
heavy firing commenced on the other side of
Lookout from us, and rumor (the soldiers telegraph)
said "that Hooker was advancing up
the west and north sides of the mountain." This
did not long lack confirmation, for our fort on
Cameron Hill soon commenced shelling the
woods that covered the mountain, save a
cleared field just below the palisades, in a very
spirited manner. This fire was returned by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>big rebel guns mounted on the summit of
Lookout, just above the palisades, but for some
reason seemed entirely ineffective.</p>

<p class='c000'>How many of those present ever heard a
vigorous cannonading in a mountainous country?
Of course, nearly all the old soldiers
present to-day have. The mountain ridges
were so situated around Chattanooga that a
single discharge of a cannon would be repeated
by the echo five and six times, the second and
third nearly as loud as the first discharge.</p>

<p class='c000'>You can therefore imagine the grandeur of
an artillery duel in these mountains. General
Grant ordered a battery down near Chattanooga
creek, that runs between the town and the base
of the mountain, which did effective work
in shelling the woods all day, and must have
been most terribly annoying to the rebels. It
was not long before we could tell by the firing
coming nearer that Hooker's veterans from the
east were driving the rebels before them, and
soon the lines of blue smoke could be seen rising
above the trees. All eyes were now centered
on Lookout, and in a short time we could
see the rebels had fallen back to the open field
below the palisades, in which at that time stood
a farm house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently we could see the lines of blue coming
from out the woods into the open field, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>from their direction and extension they must
have reached from the base of the mountain to
the palisades. The fighting seemed heaviest
on the east side of the open field; but nothing
could withstand the force of the constant charge
that Hooker was making, and when the sun
went down the rebel line was driven back well
along the east side of the mountain and nearly
opposite the west end of Missionary Ridge.
The skirmish lines kept up a constant fire until
after midnight, marking their positions by the
continuous blaze of the musketry. Two lines
of musketry running up the steep sides of a
mountain in plain view, and constantly belching
forth their tongues of flame, is a sight most
inspiring, and seen only once in a lifetime.</p>

<p class='c000'>That night the rebels abandoned Lookout,
and the next morning we greeted the grand old
stars and stripes floating proudly from the summit
of that mountain peak, in place of the
traitorous emblem that we had been compelled
to gaze upon, in disgust, for so many long sad
weeks.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE BATTLE OF MISSIONARY RIDGE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>We fought the battle of Missionary Ridge
with the great victory of the battle of Lookout
mountain as an inspiration, and the flag the
gallant Hooker planted there waiving above us.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Some have supposed that the battle of Missionary
Ridge was fought without any definite
plan save to find the enemy and fight him,
but this is an error. While the battle of Missionary
Ridge was a brilliant success, could General
Grant's plan have been carried out Bragg's
entire army must have been destroyed or captured.
Hooker was ordered to withdraw from
the mountain early in the morning of the twenty-fifth,
cross Chattanooga creek and move up the
valley to Rossville, and thereby substantially
turn Bragg's left flank. Sherman was to attack
his right flank at Tunnel Hill, while Thomas, in
direct command of the Army of the Cumberland,
was to hold the center, and fall on his rear the
moment he saw any indications that Bragg was
withdrawing to support his right or left. But it
was never intended that the ridge should be
climbed in the face of the enemy, without either
of his flanks being turned or shaken. No general
ever dreamed of the storming of Missionary
Ridge before the charge began. The best plans
of battles often fail of execution. When General
Hooker struck Chattanooga creek he found a
stream he could not ford, and was compelled to
bridge in face of the enemy and under a heavy
fire. And instead of being able to reach Rossville
early in the day, as was expected by Grant,
he found himself confronted by the enemy more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>resolute and determined than had opposed him
on the mountain the day before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sherman opened the battle on our left with
great vigor and determination, and from our
position we could see his charging columns;
but he found the enemy in a very strong position,
naturally, improved by very strong works,
and he seemed to make little, if any, progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our line ran through the edge of a small
growth of timber. To the front there was a soap-stone
plateau of about six hundred yards, before
reaching the base of the ridge, where ran a line
of the enemy's rifle pits well filled with infantry.
Our skirmish line covered the entire front of the
brigade, and soon after our position had been
taken Colonel Pickands came to the officers of
the regiment with the order that "at the firing
of six guns from Fort Wood, and the sounding
of the <em>forward</em>, we must face to the front, and
not suffer ourselves to be checked until we put
ourselves into the rebel works at the base of the
ridge."</p>

<p class='c000'>No emotion was visible in the soldierly face
of our brave colonel, save, perhaps, a little more
violent chewing of a large quid of the weed that
added rotundity to his bronzed weather-beaten
cheek. His further order was that we inform
each man in the ranks of what was expected of
him. Commanding at the time company B, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>was my painful duty to break the news to those
that I had known from boyhood, and that I had
learned to love as brothers. No one that I
communicated the order to, but turned pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Light Brigade, that Tennyson has immortalized,
was ordered "into the jaws of death,
into the gates of hell," what was to be our fate
when, the moment our line struck the open plateau,
one hundred guns would be opened on us
from the summit of the ridge; while the infantry,
safe in its works at the foot of the ridge,
would be in deadly range from the moment we
emerged from the little strip of timber that concealed
our line. Now there was nothing to do
but wait. Now the time hung heavy. Now the
soldier's thoughts were filled with home and
the loved ones left behind, and what would become
of them if he should fall in the terrific
charge that he knew would soon have to be made.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the dreadful waiting that is more terrible
than the shock of battle. When once within
the storm of the leaden hail the soldier seems
to rise to a higher plane of life; and while his
comrades fall around him, the din of battle in
his ears, the groans of the wounded and dying,
the shouts of defiance of the enemy, and encouragement
of his comrades are ringing out on every
hand, he feels as much the master of the
storm of battle as the eagle of the storm cloud.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>But the waiting at last comes to an end.
Hooker has found more difficulties in pushing
his column to the right of the ridge and in the
direction of Rossville, than had been anticipated,
and as the sun was slowly sinking toward the
crest of Waldron's Ridge the cannon belched
forth from Fort Wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every soldier of the 124th was instantly in
position, and as the silvery notes of the bugle
sounded the <em>forward</em>, and breaking the awful
silence after the cannon's reverberations had
ceased, the 124th, with clutched muskets, rushed
forth to the charge of death. As soon as we
emerged from the line of timber the rebel guns
opened on us, and the whole ridge from right
to left blazed like a volcano. The earth trembled
and shook as though in the throes of an
earthquake, while grape, canister, shell and
shrapnel bounded on the stony plain, like peas
on the threshing floor. The rebel infantry at
the base of the ridge, seeing the impetuosity of
the charge, left their works and fled to their
main line at the summit. The terrible order had
been obeyed. We had put ourselves into the
rebel works at the base of the ridge; and, looking
back over the way we had come, we saw the
solid ranks of infantry moving toward us. The
rebel artillery from the top of the ridge opened
terrible gaps and lanes in those ranks of blue;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>but nothing daunted, onward, with steady step,
they come, until they mingle with us at the foot
of the ridge. The terrible order had been obeyed,
and the mercenary soldier would have been
content to have remained in the comparative
security afforded by the hill. Not so the grand
old Army of the Cumberland; not so the grand
old 124th. <em>Without orders</em> the charge was at once
resumed. The ridge in our front is eight hundred
feet above the level of the Tennessee; in
some places almost perpendicular, but in our
front not so abrupt, but so steep that the ascent
was difficult to one without arms and accoutrements.
On rushed the gallant army; on rushed
the gallant regiment. Every soldier had all the
ardor of a Phil. Sheridan. No opportunity to
return the galling fire. Comrades falling at every
step, but at last the summit is gained. The
enemy completely routed. The guns of the
rebels turned. Plenty of ammunition found,
but no friction primers. The ingenuity of the
124th is equal to the occasion. A boy shouts
"<em>stand back</em>," fires his musket on the breech of
the cannon, and the shell goes screeching toward
the ranks of the retreating enemy, adding
consternation to panic.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the left of where we broke the line the
enemy still held out against the heroic charge
of the gallant Willich. Instantly a line of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>124th is formed, the left half-wheel executed, and
the rebels, finding their flank attacked, crumble
and finally flee in dismay. A battery of artillery
is descried in the front, being moved to the rear.
Instantly and without orders a few men form a
skirmish line and advance, and in a few seconds
every horse is shot down. The guns proved to
be a part of the celebrated Loomis battery,
taken by the rebels at Stone river.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the red sun had gone down behind the
ridge of the Cumberlands. The stars and stripes
float proudly from the entire length of Missionary
Ridge, where but a few hours before the flag
of the traitor floated in defiance of law and right.
Then went up such a shout from that mountain-top,
as was only heard, "when the morning stars
sang together, and all the sons of God shouted
for joy."</p>

<p class='c000'>The share of the trophies of the 124th was
seven cannon captured, among which was the
celebrated Washington Artillery of New Orleans,
many hundreds of prisoners, and a great
amount of small arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The storming of Missionary Ridge is the
most remarkable military success that can be
found recorded on the pages of history, of either
ancient or modern warfare. General Grant,
who was an eyewitness of the battle, says in
his official report, "the troops rushed forward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>drove the enemy from the rifle pits at the base
of the ridge like bees from a hive, stopped but a
moment until the whole was in line, and commenced
the ascent of the mountain from right
to left, almost simultaneously, following closely
the retreating enemy <em>without further orders</em>.
They encountered a fearful volley of grape and
canister from one hundred pieces of artillery
and musketry from still well-filled pits on the
summit of the ridge. Not a waiver, however,
was seen in all that line of brave men. Their
progress was steadily onward until the summit
was in their possession. I can account for this
only on the theory that the enemy's surprise at
the audacity of such a charge caused confusion,
and purposeless aiming of their pieces."</p>

<p class='c000'>The rebel general, Bragg, in his official report,
says: "No satisfactory excuse can possibly be
given for the shameful conduct of our troops in
allowing the line to be frustrated. The position
was one that ought to have been held by a line
of skirmishers <em>against any assaulting column</em>.
Those who reached the ridge did so in a condition
of exhaustion from the great physical exertion
in climbing, which rendered them powerless,
and the slightest effort would have destroyed
them."</p>

<p class='c000'>Napoleon's veterans charged the muzzle of
whole parks of Russian artillery at Borodino,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>but they had solid columns and the force of
great numbers, and no obstacles to overcome
in making that world-renowned charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Light Brigade charged the Russian redoubt
at Balaklava, only to be swept away by
the concentrated fire of the Russian batteries;
but they had the impetuosity of a cavalry movement
to drive them on <em>en masse</em>, while the storming
of Missionary Ridge was the individual
heroism of each and every man in that grand
Army of the Cumberland, and is only explained
by the <em>rebel general</em> substantially calling his
brave men cowards, who fought at Shiloh, Stone
river, and had so recently been victorious on
the dread field of Chickamauga.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great battle of Missionary Ridge was won
by the <em>individual moral force of the volunteer
union soldier</em>, never known before to the history
of warfare.</p>

<p class='c000'>That evening the moon rose over the summit
of Tunnel hill, and shone smilingly along the
bare and desolate side of Missionary Ridge, as
though the soil was not wet with the blood
of brothers. There, lying close to the rebel parapet,
was the young and brave captain, James
H. Frost, of Company I, his calm face bathed by
the soft moonlight and looking as peaceful as
though an angel guarded his slumbers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further down the bloody track of the 124th
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>lay twenty-two of its braves, "sleeping the sleep
that knows not breaking."</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>More than twenty-seven years have passed since
that heroic struggle on the steep mountain side of
Missionary Ridge. The blue and the gray sleep
side by side in the National Cemetery at its
base. Chattanooga, then a small war-battered
village, has grown, by northern capital and northern
industry, to be an important iron manufacturing
city. The Tennessee runs its bright and
winding way around the proud Lookout, but no
rebel yell pollutes the air, and no rebel rag defies
the national authority, but all is peace and
order, industry and law. And so we bid farewell
to the contemplation of one of those great
sacrifices that "saved us a nation."</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE EAST TENNESSEE CAMPAIGN, AND THE MARCH<br /> FROM CHATTANOOGA TO KNOXVILLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hooker's victorious legions had descended
from Lookout. The battle of Missionary Ridge
had been fought and won. General Geary's
division of the 20th Corps had followed the
beaten and disheartened Bragg to Ringgold,
and there attacking the enemy in his entrenched
position on the White Oak mountains, had suffered
a repulse in which the gallant 7th and 8th
Ohio lost severely. It was there that the idols
of the 7th, Colonels Crane and Creighton, fell.
But our portion of the army advanced no further
south at that time, and the 20th Corps went into
winter quarters. But no such needed rest and recuperation,
after the long time of siege and starvation
at Chattanooga, seemed to fall to the lot of
the 4th Corps of the Army of the Cumberland.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twenty-sixth day of November, 1863, the
day after the battle of Missionary Ridge, we
spent in gathering up our beloved dead from off
the mountainside where they had charged so
gallantly the day before. We brought each regiment's
sleeping braves and composed them in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>long lines, each company's by itself. I wish
those that love war, that are filled with martial
ardor, that are hoping that some complication
will involve us in a war with Great Britain, could
have walked with me along those lines of noble
dead. There lay in peaceful slumber all ages,
all sizes and forms of men, from the heavy, tall
and bearded man of fifty to the smooth-faced
lad of fifteen.</p>

<p class='c000'>O, could we feel the breaking hearts of wife,
mother, father, sister, brother, and affianced,
when the shouting was over, when the headlines
of the <em>great victory</em> had become familiar, when
the congratulatory orders and proclamations had
been issued and read, and the cold, sad news
had been conveyed to each home that claimed
a loved one lost in that great victory—then,
and only then, could we know and feel the real
horrors of war. Then, I am sure, all those that
love war and delight in the clash of arms would
lift their voices for peace—lasting peace. We
soldiers were not the real sufferers—they were
the sad, loving hearts at home. But then, as
now, duty was not to the dead, but to the living.
Their manly forms wrapped in their martial
cloaks (the soldier's coarse blanket) were tenderly
buried on that beautiful elevation known as
Orchard Knob, which was the beginning of that
National Cemetery where all the wealth that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>grateful nation and a loving people could lavish
has made it, in walks, drives, fountains, lawns,
marbles, shrubbery and flowers, one of the most
beautiful places on earth. Here the name and
rank of each soldier is registered, when known,
but alas, there are thousands there that fill unknown
and nameless graves.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the news of the siege of Knoxville had
come to us from the hundreds of miles to the
northward. Longstreet's Corps of the army of
northern Virginia had been detached from
Bragg's army before the battle of Missionary
Ridge; Bragg, relying upon the strength of the
natural fortifications that he held, considered
that it was only a question of time when the
battered remnants of Rosecrans' army, that had
been withdrawn from the lost field of Chickamauga,
must succumb to want and hunger; and
the corps commanded by Longstreet, and some
other forces of the enemy in the north and east
parts of Tennessee, could soon render the situation
of Burnside at Knoxville as helpless as
ours at Chattanooga. But the fortunes of war,
like all other things, change with time. Rosecrans
had been suspended and Hooker had
been sent by Scranton to the Tennessee in so
short a space of time that the feat was the comment
and wonder of the watching world. Grant
and Sherman had met.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The greatest living tactician and the most
consummate handler of men, were in counsel.
Then, as I have stated, Bragg was beaten and
driven away, and Sherman marched to relieve
Burnside. He was given entire command, and
within two days after the smoke of the battle of
Missionary Ridge had cleared away from the
hilltops and mountains around about Chattanooga,
Sherman's army was on the march up
the Tennessee river for Knoxville, keeping on
the east side of the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first day our brigade only marched two
miles, having to wait for the other brigades and
divisions to get out of the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>We crossed the Chickamauga river a short
distance above Chattanooga on a pontoon
bridge that had been put down by some brigade
of General Sherman's army. The next obstruction
that we encountered was a river that comes
in from the east, the name of which has slipped
my memory. This had to be crossed by the aid
of a small river steamboat that had the capacity
of taking over not much more than a company
at a trip, and we became very impatient waiting
this tedious process of transfer. It was a stern-wheel
wheezy affair, and I remember the boys
rechristened it "The River Snail," and we put in
our time making jokes at the expense of the
boat and crew, that acted as though the service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>they rendered was a matter of force, and that
they worked neither for love of country nor compensation.
At last we were safely across the
river, and the old stern-wheeler, years agone,
marks some sand bar on the Tennessee or some
of its beautiful tributaries. Shortly after this
steamboat ride of almost one hundred feet we
went into camp; the night was clear and cold,
and not being very well supplied with blankets,
we had difficulty in getting much sleep from
Old Mr. Morpheus, the god that the ancients
supposed had charge of that soothing business.</p>

<p class='c000'>November 29th we passed through the village
of Georgetown, and here we saw the
stars and stripes first displayed by any citizens
of the south. The women came out and waived
handkerchiefs and almost anything else they
could get hold of, while the "Old Blind Mice"<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
made the air vocal with shouts and cheers for
the first people that seemed to love the old flag
that we had seen since we left Louisville, Ky.
These poor people had had their homes
desolated, had been robbed of what few stores
they had by the rebel army, and, having the
name of being union people, they had been common
plunder for every rebel trooper whose
rough ride had taken him into their village. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>wonder they cheered and threw the old flags
they had kept during all those dark years of
murder, pillage and rapine to the breeze, when
they saw "Uncle Billy" marching northward with
his army that would drive the hated rebel from
their own beautiful valley.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The pet name of the 124th.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>December 6th found us in the valley of the
Little Tennessee river, a beautiful stream of
water, clear as cut glass. This valley is one of
the most wealthy sections of east Tennessee. It
may be rivaled by the Sweetwater valley, perhaps.
The inhabitants of these valleys being
rich before the war, and slaveholders, showed
nothing but rebel proclivities. We marched
through what had been once a beautiful village,
called Marysville. It must have had at one
time some two thousand population, but it was
sadly out of repair. There had been a cavalry
fight in its streets, and there was not a whole
light of glass remaining on the street that we
marched through, and the houses showed plainly
the marks of the carbine and cannon shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at about this point that General
Sherman issued his famous order, to wit: "That
any company, regiment or brigade, that struck
the enemy, should open the battle without regard
to the position of the balance of the army,
and without awaiting further orders." This was
conclusive proof we were approaching Knoxville,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>and must be within the vicinity of Longstreet's
army, and we expected to hear the battle
open every minute. But the rebel general was,
without doubt, well versed in the literature of
the nursery, and well remembered "that he who
fights and runs away, may live to fight another
day. While he who is in battle slain, can never
rise to fight again." General Longstreet, hearing
of the near approach of Sherman's army,
attacked Fort Saunders, was dreadfully repulsed
and then abandoned the siege of Knoxville,
without one of Sherman's army having the
chance to unload a musket at the boasting
veterans of the army of northern Virginia.</p>

<p class='c000'>Monday, December 7th, we marched within
two miles of Knoxville and went into camp,
having marched from Chattanooga in ten days,
over two hundred miles the way we came, having
carried our rations in our haversacks, and
eighty rounds of cartridges to the man, never
having a wagon after we left Chattanooga.
Here we met the 103d O. V. I. The major of
the 103d was a brother of our Lieutenant Colonel
Pickands, and we were well acquainted
with many of the boys of that regiment. The
greetings that followed were not only cordial
and heartfelt, but enthusiastic, and the shouts
that went forth when the boys found that Burnside's
army had been reinforced by the army
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>that marched fresh from one of the most important
victories of the war more than two
hundred miles to relieve them, awoke the
echoes among the hills of the north.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were tired and foot-sore and (to be candid
about it), even at this late day, I remember
that we much preferred being cheered to fighting
Longstreet. Those gallant fellows offered
us everything they had in the world save
something to eat and drink, which they had
not.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a night of rest only known to tired,
foot-sore soldiers, "free from war's alarms,"
Lieutenant Stedman and myself procured passes
and went into the city of Knoxville. This was
the largest city we had seen since we left Nashville,
and had a very neat and healthy appearance,
considering that it had been at times the
headquarters for both rebel and union armies.
This city is situated at the confluence of the
French Broad river, that rises in the Blue Ridge
mountains of North Carolina, and the Holston,
that comes down from the Cumberland mountains
of northeast Tennessee and Virginia, forming
the Tennessee river that flows past the city
in a deep rapid current. The Tennessee river
at Knoxville is one of those glorious streams
that the lover of nature never views without
interest, and usually with delight.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Knoxville, with its beautiful streets, its bright
and bounding river, its mountains on the west
and north, just near enough to be romantic, with
a naturally rich valley flanking it on all sides,
must ever remain one of the nicest, and one of
the most delightful, towns in the world. I have
not been there since the war, but I am told by
those that have, that, with its unbounded wealth
of iron, coal and marble, as well as its splendid
agricultural resources, added a climate that is
neither tropical nor northern, but the happy
mean between the two, its growth has been
great and substantial. I suppose a member of
the Blind Mice, finding himself in the Knoxville
of to-day, would hardly know it from what he
remembers of the Knoxville he marched to
relieve in the early winter of 1863-64.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the home of the celebrated Parson
Brownlow, and I well remember that on going
down the main street of the city this day that
we first visited Knoxville, of seeing his brave
and beautiful daughter, Kate, standing under
the flag, bowing and smiling to the union soldiers
as they raised their caps to her; all in very
great contrast to her demeanor when the rebels
held the city and she kept that same flag floating
in defiance of the rebel crew that surrounded
her on every hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>We promised her that the rebel foot should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>never again press the streets of Knoxville save
in captivity; a promise that we kept and proved
true, but how much <em>our valor</em> contributed to
that result we will see further on.</p>

<p class='c000'>This same Parson Brownlow had two sons
in the union army, James and John, commanding
at that time east Tennessee regiments.</p>

<p class='c000'>We went down to the north end of the town
and found a barber shop in full blast, and concluded
that we would indulge in the benefits
conferred by the tonsorial artist; so taking the
chair without inquiry as to terms, had our locks
put in shape, and our faces made more presentable;
but when the time for the settlement came
we found the artist only charged fifty cents for
hair cutting and thirty cents for shaving, which
caused us some surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>We next concluded to visit Fort Saunders, that
General Longstreet had made up his mind to
take a few mornings before we arrived in that
vicinity. Of course we did not see the battle,
and all I can give you is what we saw after several
days had passed. I am not certain, but I
should say that Fort Saunders stood northwesterly
of the city, and a full mile out from the
same. I do not know whether the fort was
built by General Burnside or not, but I think it
was built by him after he was sent to that department,
as the moats and parapets seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>new. There must have been timber standing
on the easterly and northerly sides at no very
great time before, as the ground was covered
with stumps, and they seemed new and strong,
as though the timber had been recently cut.
General Burnside's men, expecting the assault
(as Fort Saunders seemed to be the key to General
Burnside's position), had contrived a very
ingenious way of defense. They procured a
large quantity of telegraph wire, and stretched
it from one stump to another about knee high,
winding it around each stump a few times to
make it secure. This they did with seemingly
very great industry, for nearly all the approaches
to the fort were a perfect network of wire. They
also loaded a large number of shell with fuzes
cut at about five seconds, and had them placed
handy when the time came for the assault. This
I have from one of the defenders of the fort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as the dawn was breaking in the east
General Longstreet's assaulting column drove in
the pickets, and, with that yell that once heard is
never forgotten, came dashing on toward the fort;
but when they reached the wire they did some
ground and lofty tumbling, mostly ground, and
the fort opened a most terrible fire of musketry,
shot and shell. But nothing daunted, though
their formation was badly broken up, they came
on and soon filled the ditches around the fort.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Then the shells were lighted and thrown over
the parapets into the ditches, making fearful
havoc as they exploded among the swarming
rebels. I suppose a more determined and
bloody charge was never made during the
war. The rebels even climbed up the embrasures
of the fort, and the cannoneers cut them
down with axes.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the short range shells and the heroic
resistance made by the defenders of the fort
were too much for the unquestioned heroism
of the assailants, and what remained of them
straggled back, as best they could, to the main
body of Longstreet's army.</p>

<p class='c000'>I will not attempt to give a description of the
scene in the ditches and around the fort. It
beggars all the horrors that language can describe.
When we visited the fort of course all
the dead and wounded had been removed; but
when we came to walk along the bottom of the
moats that surrounded the fort, the evidences of
the sanguinary conflict still remained. Here lay
a tongue, there, an ear, and beyond, a jaw bone.
I saw a hand lying opposite one of the embrasures
of the fort that was cut off as smoothly as
though severed with one blow from an ax; but
though we rejoiced in a defense that saved General
Burnside's army, we were glad to leave this
scene of horror and return to camp where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Mice were resting their weary limbs after the
terrible march that we had endured.</p>

<p class='c000'>December 29th, 1863, we moved our camp to
the north into a fine piece of woods, and remained
there until the year 1863 had gone.
What a year of marchings, battles, and sorrow.
How many of those that left Camp Cleveland
with us—just one year before—now "sleep the
sleep that knows not breaking." What a change
in our regiment. Our ranks have been thinned,
but our effectiveness has been increased. We
have been tried in all the sad experiences of war.
Patriotism brought to our ranks very many
never calculated, either physically or mentally,
to make soldiers. Their intentions were high
and noble, and they failed by no fault of theirs;
their final discharge was a mercy to them, and a
blessing to us. Many came home and abandoned
army service forever. Many enlisted in other
regiments, for shorter terms and less arduous
duties; but, as a rule, <em>all did all they could</em> to
maintain the integrity of the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>January 1st, 1864, opened the most eventful
year of the war. Each army had come to its
full strength and vigor. "The summer soldier
and the sunshine patriot" had long since retired,
and we had a man as commander in chief of all
the armies that had the correct notion of the
way of putting down the rebellion. A man that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>realized that the theory of conquering rebel
territory while the rebel armies remained intact
was worse than useless. That if armies are to
be destroyed, the quicker it can be accomplished,
the more precious lives saved. Great and decisive
battles, with all their untold horrors, are
angels of mercy compared to the small battle,
the skirmish, where a few are lost and nothing
accomplished.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I find myself digressing, by the thoughts
that come crowding up, as I contemplate the
<em>value</em>(?) of our east Tennessee campaign of
1864.</p>

<p class='c000'>January 14th we struck tents, and crossing
the river marched twenty-two miles to a position
known as Strawberry Plains. I never knew
why they called it by that name unless it was
because it had no appearance of ever having
grown any strawberries, or because the foothills
of the Clinch mountains were too rough and
irregular to be called plains. I guess the fellow
that furnished the name had never been away
from home.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this march we saw the gallows where four
citizens of east Tennessee were executed. The
gallows stood hard by the side of the railroad
track. These men were executed for a very
heinous crime. It may be briefly stated: They
loved their country and their country's flag too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>well to swear allegiance to the southern confederacy,
and so they were put to death.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day we marched to Dandridge, a
small village situated on the French Broad
river, and camped in a beautiful pine woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here we had orders from Colonel Pickands
to fix up winter quarters, as we would probably
stay <em>right here</em> until the spring campaign opened,
and the pine poles were just the material from
which to construct winter quarters of the most
commodious kind. For the benefit of the Sons
of Veterans I will describe the process. You
must remember at this time we were soldiers,
and soldiers of the Uncle Billy pattern and kind.
If we had any shelter, save the starry heavens,
we had to carry that shelter on our backs, as
well as our camp equipage. Now, at this time,
you must also remember that our regiment was
divided into messes, and that by the process of
<em>natural selection</em> four men would come together
and call each other Pard. What there was that
kept these messes together I never knew. I
said they came together by <em>natural selection</em> for
the reason that when we find anything that we
cannot explain we call it <em>natural</em> and let it go.
These messes of <em>four</em> would sing, quarrel, fight,
make-up and divide all they had with each other
inside of twenty minutes. Each member of each
mess would swear that there were not three as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>good foragers in the regiment as his three
messmates. Somehow or other, a good forager
was always held up as a patron saint in the
124th Regiment. Chaplain Hubbard, of the
103d O. V. I., was the "bright and morning
star" in this business of all the members of the
army of occupation of east Tennessee. I call
it the army of occupation because, before I am
done, you will see that is all we did. Well, to
resume, each one of these four messmates would
carry one piece, at least, of shelter tent. Sometimes
more could be found, but usually, where
more were found, <em>some others had less</em>. This
<em>more</em> or <em>less</em> business was a common thing in
the army.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now in the first place the streets were laid
out, which streets were the parade grounds of
the several companies, where they were formed
and marched to the regimental parade ground.
The stumps, when we camped in the woods,
were carefully dug out of these streets, and the
same nicely graded and ditched. Then at the
left-hand side looking toward the regimental
parade ground the quarters of the messes were
erected. This I know will seem very commonplace
to the old comrade, but you will bear with
me, as I am speaking to-day to many Sons of
Veterans and others, that were too young to be
with us in this experience. The poles were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>then cut long enough to cover with two pieces of
shelter tent, then laid up, notched at the corners
to bring them down quite close, laid up high
enough so the soldier could stand upright comfortably.
The ends or gables were cobbed up
to the peak, or fixed up with the extra tents,
poles were fastened on with bark or withes, and
the tents make the roof. Then the cracks were
stopped with mud. A stick or stone chimney
is built in the back end. Two bunks are made,
one on either side, with crotches driven into
the ground, and small poles laid lengthwise and
covered with pine boughs and the U. S. army
blanket make the bed. Gun-racks are made
above each bunk for two muskets and two sets
of accouterments. An extra blanket is hung up
for a door, and the house is furnished by the inventive
genius of the mess. The bunks during
the daytime furnish upholstered seats. This
house answers for kitchen, dining room, and
dormitory, and a healthier home does not stand
in the city of Cleveland. One of the best features
of the whole business is, they were not liable
to sale under execution, or foreclosure, neither
for delinquent taxes. This house I have described
was one of a large city our division built
at Dandridge. Please note how long they were
suffered to enjoy the fruits of their ingenuity
and industry.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>If I were called upon to organize an army
that should accomplish the greatest warlike
good (if the word <em>good</em> can be used in connection
with the word <em>war</em>), I would start, in our
experience as soldiers, where we left off. The
government should never build quarters for
soldiers, they should build their own. The
government should never furnish any transportation
for well soldiers, and instead of staying in
camp, I would have them move from place to
place, thereby avoiding the disease that camps
breed. The sooner the soldier becomes self-sustaining,
within a certain limit, the better for
themselves and the service.</p>

<p class='c000'>January 16th Colonel Pickands came to my
quarters and said he had a soft snap for me;
said that I had never had a detail, that I had
stayed right with the regiment since we took the
field, and he was only too glad to confer this
favor. I thanked the genial commander, though
I had no desire to leave the Mice in that way;
and had but very little confidence in what he
said he heard from headquarters, "that we would
probably stay where we were for three months."
About ten o'clock a. m. the detail was ready,
consisting of 149 men. The order was to march
to New Market and guard the division stores.
We went through a fairly good country, and
along in the afternoon we met General Sheridan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and staff. He was riding that same black
horse that afterward "carried him into the fray
from Winchester, twenty miles away." He asked
a number of questions. The first was, if I had
heard any firing in the direction of Dandridge?
This question showed the true instinct of the
great general; that he was always looking out
for a battle, and had he been in command of the
union forces in east Tennessee, the country
would have been electrified by the news of a
signal victory won, instead of a disastrous retreat
from Dandridge, whereby so many of our
poor boys were captured, and carried to Andersonville
and death. Soon after we bade good-bye
to Sheridan and staff one of the Mice, and
he must have been one of the kind known as
<em>ground mice</em>, found an apple-hole, and before I
was aware of what was going on, the Mice were
all busy digging out apples. The owner came
out and protested; said he was a union man,
had been from the start, and his property should
be protected. I agreed in all he said, and by
the time his protest was fully entered his apples
had been transferred to the capacious haversacks
of the Mice. Of course I was to blame. I should
not have suffered the Mice to gnaw and destroy
this good man's apples; but what, I ask you,
could I do with 149 men that had not seen or
tasted an apple since the fall of 1862? I offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>to give him a voucher for the apples, and told
him if he was as good a union man as he
claimed to be the commissary department at
Knoxville would pay him. But he seemed to
know what the voucher was worth better than I
and declined the same; we marched on to New
Market, arriving there after dark, having marched
twenty-three miles since ten o'clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>I soon found nice quarters for my men in the
abandoned houses of the village, and my mess
arrangements having been broken up, I engaged
boarding with an old lady that had two sons in
the union army. This was one of the worst
battered towns I had seen in the south. The
sentiment was about equally divided between
union and rebel, and the town had been badly
plundered by both sides. The stores were at
the station on the railroad, and after relieving
the men on duty with a detail of my men, had
supper, and being very tired, the old lady showed
me a room, and I went to bed between nice
white sheets, the first time in more than twelve
months. Visions of feather beds, soft bread,
pies and cakes, no marching, no picket guard,
haunted me until 3 o'clock the next morning,
when I was awakened by a loud rapping at my
door; on getting out I saw the yellow stripes of
a cavalry orderly. He very politely handed me
an order directing me to march my detail back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>to Strawberry Plains, as the army was falling
back from Dandridge. I got out to the quarters
of the men as soon as I could, aroused the orderly
sergeant and the men, called in the guards
at the station, and started back on the railway
track for the point to which we had been ordered.
And that ended the "<em>soft snap</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'>The winter quarters the Mice had built, the
city one day old, was abandoned, and the brigade,
wearied out by marching in the deepest
mud I ever saw, slept that night under the stars
at Strawberry Plains. What became of the
stores at New Market I never knew, and why
we were ordered back I never knew. All I know
about the matter is that Uncle Billy had gone
north to meet Grant at Cincinnati, and General
Sheridan was not in command.</p>

<p class='c000'>We lost more men on the retreat from Dandridge
than would have been lost in a battle
with Longstreet, and we had men enough to
have whipped him and driven him out of
the state. But "the grand army of occupation"
was permitted to do no fighting, and so we wallowed
around in the mud of east Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few days we marched down to Knoxville
and below to a place named in honor of one of
America's greatest poets, I guess; in any event,
it had the poetical name of Lenore, and if not
<em>loved</em>, it certainly seemed <em>lost</em>. It may have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>found since the war, but it was certainly <em>lost
Lenore</em> when we were there.</p>

<p class='c000'>I suppose no part of the south suffered so
much in the way of partisan warfare as east
Tennessee. This part of the state owned very
few slaves, and the inhabitants were largely true
to the union cause. Of course, the wealthy
portion of the people were slaveholders, and
they were rebels to a man, and middle Tennessee,
Georgia, Virginia, and some portions of
North Carolina were intensely rebel, and thus
you will understand that east Tennessee was
surrounded by a disloyal population. Then,
again, the Tennessee valley was the principal
gateway from Richmond to the southwest and,
until the occupation of Knoxville by General
Burnside, this valley was continually being overrun
by rebel troops of all sorts, from infantry to
mounted bushwhackers. The disloyal, when the
rebel army was present, informed on their loyal
neighbors, and the old men, the women, and the
children had to seek safety in the woods, ravines,
and caves of the mountains, only to see their
dear old homes in flames behind them. Even
the learned and respected Judge Baxter, afterwards
appointed judge of the United States
circuit court, who, before the war, had a fine residence
and lucrative practice in the city of Knoxville,
was compelled to "lie out in the bush," as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>they call it, for three months at one time, to save
his life; and yet with most remarkable magnanimity,
through Judge Baxter's influence, not an
acre of rebel land or a rebel home was confiscated
in the whole of east Tennessee. While we were
in one of the many camps about Knoxville, the
two regiments commanded by the Brownlow
brothers, James and John, veteranized, and under
the order of the government were granted
thirty days' leave of absence. I happened to be
present at the time they disbanded. One of
these brothers made a speech to the two regiments.
I don't remember which one, but I
never can forget one thing he said: "Take your
arms with you; you will not be wanted here for
thirty days. Go home and avenge the death of
your fathers and brothers." This speech was received
by these hardy mountaineers as a license,
as it was intended to be, for murder and the
desolating torch. Not a night from that time on
for thirty days but the heavens were aglare with
the flames of rebel homes, and the number of
murders committed will never be known "until
the sea gives up its dead." But never did the
horrors of Indian massacre compare with east
Tennessee for deeds of murder and fiendish,
remorseless cruelty from 1861 to 1865.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then on the 17th moved back in the rain and
mud, and went into camp; and then on the 23d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>moved forward again, found no enemy and then
back to camp, having marched that day in the
rain and mud twenty-eight miles. Then on the
24th we struck tents and marched twelve miles
beyond Knoxville to Strawberry Plains again.
Then we were up and off to New Market. Then
the next day marched to Morristown, eighteen
miles from New Market, and occupied the abandoned
quarters built by Longstreet's men.
Stayed in this camp until March 2d, 1864, and
then marched back to New Market. This
marching and counter marching is of no particular
interest of itself, but I give it to you to
show how we put in the time. Of all the campaigning
we ever did this of east Tennessee
was the most purposeless, seemingly profitless,
and dismal. The most of the time we were
hard up for rations, and were compelled to
forage on a people as friendly as any in Ohio,
and that had been robbed by both armies. I
never can forget the time we lay at Clinch
Mountain Gap, when it was so cold that we had
to build log-heaps in front of our tents to keep
from freezing, that Colonel Pickands sent Lieutenant
Stedman with a file of men and a wagon
to try and find something to eat. I was at headquarters
when he returned at night. The colonel,
with that usual smile, said: "Lieutenant,
what success to-day?" Stedman answered:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>"Nothing." "Why?" remarked the colonel.
Stedman replied, with an oath so terrific that I
am sure it was heard in Heaven (and which I
hope the recording angel has blotted out, and
I know he has if he has attended strictly to business),
"that he would be —— —— before
he would rob women and children." When the
recording angel became acquainted with the
noble Stedman, fresh from the bloody field of
New Hope Church, I am sure the accounts were
properly adjusted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, this must end my recollections of the
very celebrated march from Chattanooga to
Knoxville and the winter campaign of east
Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Longstreet finally went back to the
army of northern Virginia, not that he was in
any danger from us, but simply because he became
tired of the scenery and wanted a change,
I suppose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing in history is grander than the relief
of Knoxville; nothing tamer and more devoid
of sense than the balance of the campaign. Yet
we can draw from it all this useful lesson, that
those brave spirits, the noble men that endured
the march and campaign, had a patriotism and
endurance that nothing of storm, of cold, of
hunger, of sickness, of bad management could
dampen. And though many of that band sleep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>in southern graves, yet many lived to bring
back the stars and stripes in triumph from the
greatest conflict of modern times and to see the
rebellious states restored to a peaceful and happy
union.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE ATLANTA CAMPAIGN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The spring of 1864 opened with millions of
anxious patriots looking in the direction of our
armies.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Grant had virtually been made commander
in chief of all the union forces, with
personal direction of the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every lover of his country had come to understand
that the policy of conquering rebel
territory and guarding rebel property would
never crush out rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The military policy of General Grant, of making
the objective point of campaigns <em>the rebel
armies</em>, met the good sense and received the
hearty approval of the patriotic people of the
United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some raised the cry of "butcher," but every
thoughtful man that knew the desperate intentions,
the bravery, the skill, and the strong defensive
positions occupied by the rebel armies,
knew that their destruction meant severe
marches, terribly destructive battles, thousands
of brave men killed, and vastly more wounded
and maimed for life; but in the face of all these
mighty sacrifices, that the poverty of language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>will not enable us to describe, the patriotic
people of the north said, "We will sustain the
army at all hazards," and the armies responded,
"Let us set forward."</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a well-known fact that in the winter of
1864, at the Burnett House in the city of Cincinnati,
Ohio, the two greatest generals developed
by the war, Grant and Sherman, met in
counsel. Sherman, while a line officer in the
regular army, had become most thoroughly
acquainted with the topography of the state of
Georgia, and it was at this consultation that the
campaign from Chattanooga to Atlanta and the
grand march "from Atlanta to the sea" were developed
and determined upon. It was at this consultation
that Sherman said, "The confederacy
is a shell and I can march an army through it." It
was at this consultation that Grant said, "If you
undertake it, I will hold Lee and his armies,
that they give you no trouble." At the end of
this meeting each of the great commanders repaired
to his respective scene of action to carry
forward the purposes determined on thereat.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first of May, 1864, found assembled in
the vicinity of Chattanooga, and as far south
as Ringgold, Ga., the forces with which General
Sherman proposed to crush the shell of
the rebellion. It consisted of the Army of the
Cumberland, General George H. Thomas in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>command; the Army of the Tennessee, under
the especial command of General McPherson;
the 23d Corps, commanded by General Schofield;
the 20th Army Corps, still in command
of the hero of Lookout mountain, "Fighting
Joe Hooker," as he was often called in army
circles, and also a brigade of regulars. Then
as able lieutenants in command of corps and
divisions, Sherman had Logan, Blair, Sickels,
Stanley, Wood, Slocum, Osterhaus, and many
others, <em>all fighting officers</em>. Sheridan, at that
time, had been transferred to the Army of the
Potomac by the especial order of General Grant,
who witnessed General Sheridan's heroic conduct
at Missionary Ridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>I suppose very few of the people of the north
ever had anything like a correct idea of the
magnitude of the work undertaken by General
Sherman in the campaign of Atlanta. The
distance from Louisville to Nashville is stated
to be one hundred and eighty-five miles, and
from Nashville to Chattanooga it is said to be
one hundred and fifty-one miles, and from
Nashville to Bridgeport on the Tennessee river,
two hundred and eleven miles. This long line
of railway from Louisville to Chattanooga, and
from Nashville to Bridgeport, Ala., five hundred
and forty-seven miles, had to be guarded by
military force every mile. For it must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>remembered that while the state of Kentucky
never went out of the Union and was ostensibly
a loyal state, nevertheless, it required more
soldiers to look after its disloyal citizens than
she furnished to the cause of the Union, not
for one moment forgetting that the state of
Kentucky furnished some as brave and loyal
soldiers as ever sprung a rammer and some as
valiant officers as ever drew a saber. Notwithstanding,
she had a large population in the aggregate
that engaged in that disreputable kind of
warfare known as <em>bushwhacking</em>, and very many
that did not were ever ready to furnish aid and
comfort to our enemy. Again, no portion of
Tennessee, save east Tennessee, laid any claim
to anything but intense love of the southern
confederacy. Blockhouses had to be constructed
every few miles of this route and a vast number
of soldiers employed in keeping open this line
of communications. Nashville was the grand
base of supplies, where had been accumulated
for many months all kinds of army stores, and
from this base General Sherman had to draw
supplies of rations, ammunition, and clothing
for his campaign in Georgia; while the route
from Nashville to Louisville must be kept open
to renew the supplies at the base, as well as to
send the sick and wounded to the northern
hospitals.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>It is almost needless for me to state before this
intelligent audience that the genius of General
Sherman was entirely equal to the emergency.
And while the oddities and comical features of
great men will usually be better remembered than
any others, those of us that participated in that
memorable campaign will remember well that
no precautionary matter was overlooked by the
ever watchful general. If what he really meant
by "light marching order" was so difficult to
understand that a cavalryman construed it to
mean "necktie and a pair of spurs," he was no
less exacting of himself and staff and many a
night on this campaign he bivouacked as would
a picket on an outpost. The thoroughness of
his preparation was the sequel of his success.
Knowing very well that overrunning rebel territory
did not make loyal citizens of its inhabitants,
he took the precaution to have his engineers
make drawings of every wooden bridge
between Louisville and Chattanooga, and between
Nashville and Bridgeport. Nor was this
all. He had his corps of mechanics construct
duplicate bridges for the entire line south of
Nashville. He was not satisfied only with his
precautions to guard and care for his line of
communications to his base of supplies, but he in
some manner procured plans of the bridges from
Chattanooga to Atlanta, and had bridges constructed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and loaded on flat cars ready for use at
any time when wanted. It was perfectly astounding
the perfect order and dispatch with which he
reconstructed the railroads as his campaign progressed,
and with such celerity did his engineer
corps perform its duty that after the bridge was
burned by the rebel rear guards the same would
be rebuilt, and the screams of the locomotive
would mingle with the rattle of the musketry of
the skirmishers just across the river, always reminding
us that Uncle Billy's railroad was in
good working order and that our "cracker line"
was secure. But the vigilance of his preparation
was not satisfied with being able to keep up his
railroad lines—he had the finest pontoon corps
that was ever organized.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each man was drilled in the movements
necessary to put down a pontoon bridge or remove
one from the water and replace the same
on the wagons as efficiently as an infantryman
in the manual of arms or a cannoneer in the
handling of a fieldpiece. It was a sight that
seemed the perfection of celerity to witness his
pontoon corps put down a bridge, and every
line of march was thoroughly equipped in this
particular.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what I have heretofore described were not
all the obstacles in the way of the making of
the Atlanta campaign a success. While we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>beyond the Tennessee mountains, while we had
crossed the Tennessee river, the country from
Ringgold to the south bank of the Chattahoochee
river was naturally most admirable defensive
ground. Every few miles were high ridges
and small mountain ranges remarkably well
adapted for defensive military positions; added
to this the enemy had no rear that required
guarding, had no hostile population to
watch and distrust, had the most accurate information
as to streams and roads, had swarms
of volunteer spies to inform him of our every
movement, and finally, had an army of slaves to
do his intrenching ready to his hand and use
when he was ready to fall back to a new position.
This, all this, and more than I have time
to describe, must be considered if we would
thoroughly comprehend the military magnitude
of the Atlanta campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>When General Sherman was ready to commence
the forward movement, there must have
been assembled from Chattanooga to Ringgold
between eighty and one hundred thousand men,
and on the third day of May, 1864, just as the
magnolias were beginning to open their fragrant
blossoms to the south wind, and the mocking
birds were beginning to make the woods
vocal with their songs, our division struck tents
and commenced the march southward, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>evening of the fourth found us two and one-half
miles from Ringgold confronting the enemy's
pickets. From this time until the ninth we made
short marches southward, skirmishing with the
rebels each day. On the ninth our brigade was
composed of the 124th O. V. I., the 41st O. V.
I. the 93d O. V. I., the 9th I. V. I., and the 6th
Ky. V. I. The brigade was commanded by
General William B. Hazen and we had moved
as far toward Dalton as a position known locally
as Buzzard's Roost, a pass in the White
Oak mountains. Here we found the rebels in
position, the pass strongly fortified and commanded
by a number of heavy guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this position our brigade had an order to
charge the mountain at the left of the pass,
which order was executed, and we came within
two hundred yards of the top of the mountain,
where we found it broken off into palisades
thirty feet in height. These palisades we had
no means of ascending and so the charge ended.
Our regiment lost three men killed and ten
wounded. This movement was afterwards explained
as a demonstration to deceive the
enemy, but some of us will always think that
we were the ones that were deceived. There was
heavy firing on the right of the pass and in the
direction of Snake Creek Gap, where a portion
of Hooker's Corps fought a severe battle, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>29th O. V. I. losing very heavily. While in
this position (Buzzard's Roost) we were terribly
annoyed by sharpshooters posted above the
palisades, the bugler of the 93d being killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>All things considered, this position was properly
named, and had Dore been there he could,
without doubt, within the wilds of that mountain,
have found some new illustrations for
Dante's Inferno.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the morning of the 13th we found
the rebels had abandoned their position, and a
party of us, while waiting for orders to move,
managed to climb to the top of the mountain.
Here we had a splendid view of the scenery of
northern Georgia. Away to the north we could
see old Lookout towering up, while beyond we
could distinctly trace Waldron's and other ridges
of the Cumberlands. To the south and west
one range of hills after another, with an occasional
mountain, as far as the eye could reach,
showing us that our way was one of difficulty
as well as danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>About two p. m. we fell into line, marched
into and through the pass, and had time to
examine the strength of the abandoned rebel
works. These works were evidently constructed
with the hope that our commander would undertake
to force the pass. That afternoon we
marched through Dalton, a small village situated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>near an unbroken forest of pine, a kind
from which the inhabitants make turpentine.
The country seemed very poor, and from what
we could see of the inhabitants we were
forced to come to the same conclusion as to
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day, May 14th, we struck the enemy
in position at Resaca, and we immediately
charged and drove him inside of his works,
while our brigade occupied the line of a ridge
running from near an angle of the rebel works
and within a stone's throw of them. In this
charge our young Colonel Payne, then in command
of the regiment, just having returned recovered
from a very dangerous wound received
at Chickamauga that nearly cost him his life,
showed consummate bravery, riding his horse
in the charge across an open field in a perfect
storm of bullets.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was nearly dusk when we came into position,
and before we took the ridge that finally
formed our line, had some severe fighting. We
had the opportunity of seeing a counter charge
against General Willich's brigade on our right.
The rebels came at Willich in fine shape, just
as he was coming into position, but it seemed
they had no real good appetite for an open field
fight and got back into their works in the order
of "every one for himself." That night we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>threw up intrenchments on this line and the
next morning the enemy still confronted us.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had orders early in the day that we should
be required to charge the enemy's position in our
front. In our immediate front there is a deep
ravine, and the rebel works ran across this at
right angles to our line. Whenever we charged
from our works our right flank was exposed to the
fire from the rebel intrenchments. At about two
p. m. the charge was ordered and our line moved
out over our intrenchments. No sooner was it
exposed to the flank fire from the enemy behind
the works than it went to pieces. Most of the
men got back in as good shape as did the rebels
that charged on Willich. Some of our regiment
got into a position where they could not return
with any safety, and stayed out and came in under
the cover of darkness. Later in the afternoon
the 20th Corps made two or three attempts to
break the rebel line, but each time failing, and
when the morning of the sixteenth dawned the
enemy had abandoned his works and put the
little river called Coosa between himself and us.</p>

<p class='c000'>What good results the battle of Resaca may
have had on the campaign I cannot say, but it
is certain the enemy was forced back by some
movement made by General Sherman on his
flanks that would compel him to fight outside
of his works. We took a number of prisoners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>at this position, and our regiment lost quite
severely. We marched through the town and
found it all knocked into splinters by the shelling
it had suffered during the two days' battle.
We crossed the river and marched about five
miles to the southward that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The experience of one day did not vary much
from that of another. The seventeenth we
marched through a county town called Calhoun,
county seat of Gordon county. It was march
and skirmish every day. This is a better country
than any other we had seen in northern Georgia,
but desolation was written all over it after we
passed. At almost every plantation we came
to the rebels made a stand and the mansion
house a fortress from which to fire at our skirmishers,
and when we drove them out the
house almost invariably took fire, and at all
times of day and night the heavens were lurid
with the flames of rebel homes. The country
from Resaca to the Etowah river was the most
absolutely desolated of any that we ever left
behind us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between Cartersville and Adairsville I picked
up a muster roll of a company of an Alabama
regiment that had written thereon eighty-four
names. Until I found this roll I was not aware
the Roman Catholic church was so strong in the
south. The four commissioned officers signed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the roll by their signatures, but the enlisted men
each <em>put the sign of the cross</em> in the place of the
signature. On this march one of the boys found
a copy of the debates of the Georgia convention,
held in the winter of 1860-61, at which the
state resolved to go out of the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>It contained the speech of Alexander H. Stevens,
made in the convention, in which he warned
the delegates of the deluge of blood and fire
that would be poured down on their fair state
by the invading armies of the north. It seemed
almost prophetic to us who read this speech in
the light of those blazing southern homes, and
it also seemed that we were the ones he saw in
his prophetic vision. Of course, all the prophetic
power he had was the keen intellectual force he
possessed, and whether he believed his own
prophesies or not, he was afterward chosen vice
president of the confederate states and served
as such during the life of the rebellion. This
book was carried along for days, hoping to save
it as a relic of this memorable campaign, but
the time comes in the experience of every soldier
when a pocketknife seems a burden, and this
book, containing all the venom of the southern
fire-eaters, couched in language not only learned
and chaste in style, but eloquent in diction, had
to be thrown away. Stevens, alone, tried to
stem the tide of secession, "but it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>voice of a drowning man in the midst of the
breakers."</p>

<p class='c000'>With marching and skirmishing every day the
time wore away, and May 23d found us on the
north bank of the Etowah, a fine river that comes
down from northeastern Georgia, the valley of
which seemed very fertile and productive. This
river we crossed on one of Sherman's lightning
bridges and struck out over what is known,
locally, as the burnt hickory district, across the
ridges of the Allatoona mountains in the direction
of Dallas. Here Hooker's Corps had a
heavy battle, but our corps was not engaged.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next position taken by the enemy was
known as Dallas, though the battles along the
position were known by different names. I
should say before passing that we were now in
what (before the discovery of gold in California)
was known as the gold region of Georgia. Our
boys brought in from time to time, while in this
position, some beautiful specimens of gold bearing
and crystallized quartz, but I suppose they
had to be thrown away to lighten the burden
of the soldier when the time comes that one has
to give thought and close attention to be able
to put one leg before the other. This seems
hardly probable to my young friends here to-day,
so full of health and activity, but how many
times have we heard the dear boys say, "Captain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span><em>I cannot take another step to save my life</em>."
Often we would pull out of the road and go into
camp near some clear mountain stream, and you
would see the boys pulling off their shoes and
stockings and holding their blistered feet in the
cool water by the half-hour, before making any
preparations for supper or sleep. But what pen
will ever be able enough, what tongue will be
eloquent enough, to portray the trials and sufferings
of the march and battlefield, to say
nothing of sickness, death and wounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>May 26th our corps found the enemy in
position at what was known as Dallas. That
night the rebels attacked General Logan's Corps
and were badly repulsed. This was the only
serious night attack I ever knew in all my army
experience. All have known more or less firing
at night, but this was the first and only charging
column that I ever knew to be sent off at night.
There seems to be too much uncertainty about
it to favor nocturnal battles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early the twenty-seventh we were on the
move, my company on the skirmish line. About
ten o'clock we heard that our beloved major,
James B. Hampson, who was on staff duty with
General Wood, commanding division, was killed.
This was very sad news, indeed, as the major
was idolized by the regiment, and we all recognized
the fact that he had done so much to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>soldiers of us. He was one of the most intelligent,
soldierly and brave officers in the 4th
Army Corps. One thing was a little strange,
the major always insisted that he would be killed
in the service. Early in the war the major was
a member of the Cleveland Grays, and belonged
to that splendid organization for many years
before. He was, without doubt, the best drilled
man in the 3d Division.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to be the object of General Sherman
to put the 4th Corps in on the left, find the
right flank of the enemy, "catch it in air," if
possible, bring on a general engagement, destroy
the rebel army, and thereby end the campaign.
It was the fortune of Company B, which I commanded,
to be ordered to the skirmish line, with
other portions of the brigade, and which line in
front of our division was in command of Major
Williston, of the 41st O. V. I. Very many times
that day we moved to the front, but always
found the enemy in very strong works, and then
we would withdraw and move by the left flank
still further to the left. Late in the afternoon
we came near the Pumpkinvine creek, and found
the rebels without works. This fact was immediately
reported to division headquarters. We
drove the rebel skirmish line back on his line of
battle. Colonel Payne sent me an order to force
the skirmish line well to the front, and word was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>sent back that we were fighting the main line of
the enemy, not one hundred feet away. The
rebel line was on the top of a ridge that runs
along the valley of the creek, and is naturally a
very strong position. Soon the brigade came
up and charged the hill, but was unable to go
beyond our skirmishers. Later on General
Howard put in General Wm. H. Gibson's brigade,
the general leading the charge on foot.
Never did I see men show more courage than
did Gibson's brigade in this charge, but all was
unavailing. The rebels reinforced their line
with General Pat. Cleburne's division, and
thereby far outnumbered the men we had engaged
in the action. Had an entire division
been put in between our left and Pumpkinvine
creek mill pond, early in the afternoon, I believe
the result would have been different. As it was
a brigade was fought at a time, on a very short
line where the hill was steepest, and the enemy's
position the most unassailable. The result was
that our brigade was the worst cut up of all the
battles in which we were engaged. We fought
in this position until dark, and then what was left
of the two brigades, that had been put into this
slaughter pen, withdrew to the other side of the
valley. I have said that my company was on the
skirmish line and opened the battle, and fought
with the main line when the same came up.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>About four o'clock in the afternoon I went over
to the left of the line to see how the battle was
progressing in that quarter, and met Lieutenant
Stedman where an old road comes winding
down the hill. I made some inquiry as to how
the boys were getting on, and he told me Adam
Waters had been killed. Adam Waters was
one of the best men of our company. He also
informed me that a great many others of the
company and regiment were badly wounded.
He said: "Captain, we can hold this position
until reinforcements come up, can we not?" I
replied, "I think so, but what we want is to carry
this hill." I was facing up the hill, and he stood
with his face toward me, and so near that I could
have laid my hand on his shoulder. All at once
a great stream of blood spouted from his left
breast. He gave me one look, as much as to
say "my time has come," and sank in my arms,
dead. I moved his body out of the road, and
folded his arms across his breast. I took his
watch and memorandum book, and laid his new
and beautiful saber on his body, marked the tree
under which he laid with my knife, so I could
find the spot again, and amid the thunders of
battle I left him reposing on the loving breast of
mother earth, while sadly I left for another part
of the field. There on that lone hillside was
sacrificed one of the very few absolutely brave
men I ever knew. I moved over to the right of
the line, and there I saw Captain John Irving,
sitting up, his body reclining against the body
of a small sapling, smoking his pipe, his face as
white as the driven snow. I said: "Captain are
you wounded?" "Yes, it is all day with me,"
he replied. I asked him where he was wounded,
he pointed to his right groin. I learned from
him that Lieutenant Colonel Pickands and Captain
Wm. Wilson were also wounded. Captain
John Irving died at the hospital at Chattanooga
some weeks afterward. I think the 124th O.
V. I. never had a line officer that was held in
higher respect, for his great bravery, soldierly
conduct, as well as social qualities, than Captain
John Irving.</p>

<p><em>CAPTAIN JOHN B. IRWIN.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>It was now quite dark, and the firing had
ceased all along the line. The few men that
came out of the battle together gathered around
Colonel Payne. He was all alone. His gallant
major had been killed early in the day, and
his lieutenant colonel had been dangerously
wounded. Of course, we had hopes that many
more would come in during the night, as we
were withdrawn from the field in squads, and
without any word of command that all could
hear, and the men were coming in all night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night was very dark, and I proposed to
Sergeant Orson Vanderhoef of our company,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>that if he and two others would volunteer to go
with me we would go over to the hillside and
bring off the body of Lieutenant Stedman.
Ort. was made of the best of stuff, and with two
others, as good, we started. Never saw I such
a scene before. The old dead pine trees standing
on the ridge had taken fire from the bursting
shells and cast a weird and gloomy light over
the battlefield. When we came to the old road
we followed it up and soon came to the tree
under which the body of the dead lieutenant lay.
Some one had taken his saber that I so much
wanted to send home to his only child, at that
time a small boy, but we searched in vain for it.
I never can forget the terrible sounds that filled
our ears. When the wounded men discovered
that some one was there they began such piteous
appeals for help. "For God's sake can't you
give me a drop of water?" "Can't you help me
off the field, so I may not be captured?" The
memory of that dread scene haunts me still, and
I suppose will as long as I can turn in fond
recollection to those brave men that were so
ruthlessly sacrificed at the battle of New Hope
Church. Would it not be the proper thing for
General O. Howard (between his prayers) to
explain why he left that hillside with its great
number of wounded men to fall into the hands
of a merciless enemy, when a good skirmish line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>could have held it, at least until the wounded
could have been removed? I would not have
propounded this inquiry had I not seen some
of his war articles in a popular magazine. But
I must return to my sad story. I said to Sergeant
Vanderhoef that he and I would take the
shoulders, and the others might divide the
balance of the burden, as Ort. and I were a little
the more muscular of the party. We had just
stooped down to raise the body of our loved
comrade when there rang out the silvery notes of
a bugle, so clear and soft one might have mistaken
it for some night bird's call. Ort. said:
"Captain, what's that?" I said: "I guess that is
some artillery call. It is certainly not an infantry
call." Ort. said: "By G—d, it's the <em>rebel
forward</em>, I've heard it many a time on picket,
and we'd better be getting out of here pretty
G—d d—d quick." Just at this instant a rebel
skirmisher stepped into the old road, and the
blaze of his musket went away past where we
stood. I whispered to separate instantly, and
away we went down the hill. The firing had
now become general all along the line, telling
the story only too plainly that the field, with all
of its wealth of dead and wounded comrades,
had been abandoned to the tender mercies of
one of the most cruel enemies that ever fought a
battle. Common humanity would have dictated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>that a fresh line should have been established
on that field, and maintained there until the last
wounded union soldier had been tenderly borne
back to the field hospital. The only reason the
rebels charged over that battlefield that night
was because they knew no line of union skirmishers
was there to oppose them, and they
could plunder the brave dead and wounded
without danger of molestation.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as one was away from the light of
the burning pines it was so dark one could not
see a hand before him, and the first thing that I
realized I was up to my neck in Picket's mill
pond; but, being a Baptist, that did not astonish
me to any alarming extent. I groped around
in the darkness not knowing whether my wandering
steps were bearing me into our lines or
the rebels'. At length, about three o'clock a. m.,
I came upon a group of men and asked who
they were. One replied they were General
Howard and staff. I told them my name, rank,
company and regiment, as well as brigade and
division, and asked for directions. None of
them could give any and I was about to leave
when it occurred to me that was the corps commandant,
and I, as an officer, had a duty to
perform. I addressed the general, begging his
pardon for the intrusion, and told him that I
had been driven off the battlefield, and that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>was not so much as a union picket between
our lines and the rebels. You might have supposed
that he thanked me for the information,
and that he would have said "that he would
have the matter looked into," but on the contrary
his reply was: "There is not a word of truth in
your story, sir. Go away from here, this is my
headquarters." I went immediately away reflecting
how it was possible for a man to be
such a devout Christian and a corps commander,
and still be so little of a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I found the regiment they were intrenching,
and I worked with them until daylight,
when we found our works faced to the
rear. We soon put out a skirmish line, reformed
our works, and this battle under the different
names of Picket's Mills, Pumpkinvine creek and
New Hope Church, was the last engagement
in which our brigade took part on the rebel
position known as Dallas.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this battle of New Hope Church, just
described in the poor way that a line officer has
of seeing such a conflict, our regiment lost very
heavily in officers and men. I see by a note I
made at the time that the brigade in this action
lost five hundred and sixty men. We remained
in this position for a number of days, skirmishing
and fighting, somewhere, almost constantly.
It was at this position that we had the benefit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>a lesson and example from the regular brigade.
On this line the regulars joined us on the left.
The rebel skirmish line ran along by the edge
of a wood, while from our line to theirs the
ground was open and comparatively level. To
avoid losing men, we put our skirmishers out
before daylight in the morning, avoiding any
formal "guard mounting," and relieved them
after dark at night. The regulars took the <em>regular
regulation way</em>. At nine o'clock every
morning they had "guard mounting," omitting
no formality of the same. The rebel skirmish
line, safe in their pits, firing into them all the
time. The new line going out under fire, and
the relieved one coming back under the same
conditions. This occurred every morning as
long as we remained in this position. I am not
certain whether this fact ever came to the knowledge
of the general officers or not, but the fact
became so notorious that the men from all along
our brigade were in the habit of coming in
behind our works to witness the "<em>regular guard
mounting</em>." They used to lose from two to
five men every morning. The boys used to call
it the "regular slaughter pen."</p>

<p class='c000'>We remained in this position until the fifth of
June, when we found that Sherman's flanking
process had done its work and the rebels had
abandoned their position, and we moved to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>left to within three miles of Ackworth. From
this time until we again struck the rebel position,
the twenty-second of June, it was march, skirmish
and intrench. This gave us but little rest,
and the boys were looking haggard and careworn.
This constant skirmishing, this no place
of safety, this constant alarm, and night work on
intrenchments, seemed to fatigue and wear out
men more than fighting hard battles, followed
by security and rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had now pushed our line as far south as
Marietta, a beautiful town, situated just north of
the Chattahoochee river, and just south of
Kennesaw mountain. This country of central
Georgia is somewhat peculiar in its formation.
There are no distinct mountain ranges south of
the Allatoonas, but here and there a beautiful
little mountain rises all alone above the
surrounding country, that seems very much like
table-land, though not level enough to bear that
appellation. Among these solitary mountains,
the names of which I remember, are Pine, where
the rebel general, Bishop Polk, was killed before
we reached our present position, Kennesaw
mountain, Lost mountain and Stone mountain.
All these little mountains were taken advantage
of, as defensive positions, by the enemy; and
here at Marietta the rebel line ran over the
north side of Kennesaw, making an admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>position for its right flank. Here we forced
our way very close to the enemy's works and in
some places our works approached theirs to
within two hundred feet, so that neither army
could have a skirmish line beyond its works.
When we were coming into this close position,
the rebels made a charge and were repulsed with
great slaughter; and their dead lay there unburied
until after they abandoned this line.
Some of us went over this portion of the line,
and it was with difficulty that we picked our way
among the rebel dead. I never saw the dead
lie thicker, save at Chickamauga; and it took a
strong man to stand the terrible stench that
arose from that field in this almost tropical
climate. I think this position of the enemy was
the strongest of any we had encountered, and
for the benefit of those that were not there I will
describe these rebel works and defenses. In
the first place there was the timber, the trees
were felled and the tops turned outward, the
small branches all trimmed off and the large
ones sharpened. These trees, so trimmed, were
placed contiguously to each other, and the buts
staked down with heavy stakes driven deep into
the ground. This first line of rebel defenses
was about shoulder high to an ordinary man,
and could only be cleared away by axmen.
Their second line was constructed in this wise:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>A ditch was dug about four feet deep, pine
poles from three to four inches in diameter were
cut and sharpened to a point, set about four
inches apart at an angle of about forty-five
degrees, facing outward, and coming up about
breast high. This ditch was filled with earth,
and tamped solidly, then near the ground these
sharpened stakes were woven together with
withes. A more formidable defense could
hardly be invented. Their third line of defense
required more labor. They cut pine logs about
twelve inches in diameter, and bored them
through the center at right angles, with three
inch augers; these holes were filled with pine
poles six feet long sharpened at each end, and
driven through the log just halfway. These
logs were halved together and pinned, and the
splices wrapped with telegraph wire, thus making
a continuous line. This defense is what the
French call <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chevauxdefrise</span></i>, and is just as formidable
one side up as the other, and cannot be
gotten over without axmen. Finally, the rifle
pits, with head-logs thereon, leaving a space of
about three inches, through which an infantryman
could aim and fire in comparative safety,
the head-logs fully protecting the head above
the line of sight. These defenses were placed
and constructed about fifteen rods apart, and all
within the deadly range of the Enfield rifle with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>which our mother country had armed the confederacy;
and a more accurate, longer range
muzzle-loader was never invented. A portion
of the enemy's line, with defenses just as I have
described above, General Sherman tried to carry
by assault the twenty-seventh day of June, and
lost three thousand men in fifteen minutes,
General Newton making the assault with the
first division of the 4th corps. Our brigade was
in position to support the assaulting columns
and we saw the disastrous charge, but the
charge failing we were not put in. Here the
brave young General Harker was killed, while
leading one of the assaulting columns. That
the charge would fail was inevitable. A single
line of battle of the enemy, armed as they were,
inside of such defenses, could repulse any mass
of men that could be sent against them. It
would require a man without a musket and
accouterments, armed with a good ax, from five
to ten minutes to cut through these three outer
lines of defenses, and the idea of assaulting such
a position without first having these defenses
cleared away, was entirely preposterous. It
would have cost the killing or wounding of one
thousand axmen to have cleared the way for a
regimental front to charge. After the terrible
disaster of the twenty-seventh of June, 1864,
General Sherman came out in a long general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>order, which was in fact a very weak excuse for
this disastrous blunder, and winding up in substance
as follows: "My soldiers must learn that
they must charge in all places, and that we cannot
depend at all times upon flank movements."</p>

<p class='c000'>I suffer no man, no old soldier, to stand before
me in my admiration for the services rendered
our country by that grand old hero, General W.
T. Sherman, but in military life, like civil life, a
man may be very valuable and great in one
direction, and of very little value in another.
That general was not developed during the war
for the suppression of the rebellion, that could
handle one hundred thousand men in such a
fine manner, keeping them all in hand, like
General Sherman. But when it came to fighting
in a country the Atlanta campaign was
fought over, with the defenses his army had to
meet, his corps commanders, and his men
generally, had very little confidence in his
judgment. This feeling, that he knew was quite
general, was the inspiration of the famous order
that I have referred to before, issued after the
battle of Kennesaw mountain, June 27th, 1864.
I have it on the authority of Colonel Payne, that
Generals Thomas, Logan, McPherson and others
of his generals on the campaign, persuaded him
out of many an assault he had ordered, that
would have been as disastrous as that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Kennesaw mountain. But that any of them
had the ability to do as well as he did I do not
believe. General Thomas had the best of judgment
in fighting a battle and what men could
do and should attempt, but he would never
have gotten his army there as Sherman did. Of
course General Sherman never <em>admitted</em> his
mistake in ordering the assault at Kennesaw,
but we all remember he never <em>repeated</em> it during
the remainder of the campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the position in front of Kennesaw we saw
trees twelve inches in diameter cut completely
off by the fire of musketry alone—simply bitten
out, piece by piece, until the trees would fall.
You can imagine about how much ammunition
was expended?</p>

<p class='c000'>On the third of July we found the rebels had
again retired, and we followed up, passing
through Marietta. We made a short stop near
the Georgia State Military Institute. Some of
us went up on one of the buildings and had a fine
view of the surrounding country. We marched
in all to the southward six miles this day, and
turned in to get ready to celebrate the glorious
fourth, to-morrow. The morning of the fourth
opened with more than a national salute, and
though we did not do much fighting there was
plenty of cannonading on our right, and it was
currently reported in camp that fifteen hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>prisoners had been captured, which caused "the
day we celebrate" to be indeed a glorious
fourth. The fifth we found the rebels had again
abandoned their works in our front, and our
regiment deployed as skirmishers, and held the
advance of the division. We found, on the top
of the hill that overlooks the Chattahoochee
river, a "<em>butternut</em>" that had evidently tired of
the southern confederacy, for, as Hood puts it,
had "enlisted in the line." He had bent down
a sapling, fastened a piece of bark around "his
melancholy neck" and to the sapling, and then
let go. He was one of those lank, lean rebels
that had not flesh enough on his bones to even
decay. He had dried up like a piece of beef,
and was an elegant specimen of a confederate
mummy. This item of news in time of peace
would, undoubtedly, have furnished a sensational
article for a Marietta paper, but the boys
cut him down and the line moved on.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon, as we approached the river,
from the top of a high hill we saw Atlanta. It
looked as good to us as the promised land did
to Moses, as there we saw the end of this
terribly exacting and fatiguing campaign. As
we were driving the rebels down to the river, at
the south side of an open field, the rebels
erected rail barricades, from which it gave us
some trouble to dislodge them. I thought by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>swinging the left of our line around we could
"gobble them in," and not expose our center to
their fire, protected as they were, and had sent
word to that effect to Captain Raidaie, who had
charge of that portion of the line. About this
time General Tommy Wood, commander of
our division, rode up, accompanied by one
orderly. Without waiting for me to carry out
my little strategy, or in fact consulting me at
all, he at once ordered a charge. "Go in, brave
boys." "Go in, brave boys." We, of course,
drove the Johnnies from their rail barricade with
the most perfect safety, as they put in all the time
we were "double quicking" across the field,
shooting at "Old Tommy;" fortunately the old
general was in such a state of <em>spiritual exhilaration</em>
that he was in no danger of getting hurt.
That night we drove the last rebel across the
Chattahoochee river, and went into camp for
several days.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had been on the campaign sixty-three
days. The enemy had been flanked out of four
very strong positions, but nothing like a general
engagement had been fought, nothing like a
decisive battle had been won. Owing to the
fact that where battles had been fought the
enemy fought behind his works, on very advantageous
ground, our losses must have been very
much more severe than his. Our base of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>supplies was every day growing farther away,
and our line of communications therewith
requiring more men to guard. With the exception
of the fact that we had run over some
rebel territory, that we left in a condition to feed
no more rebels, what had we gained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy during all these long weeks had
been commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston.
Of all the defensive officers, developed by the
war on either side, I do not believe General
Joseph E. Johnston had an equal. In the face of
a vastly superior army, he had held four positions,
fought many battles, and finally crossed
the Chattahoochee river, and General Sherman
had not been able to force him into a decisive
engagement.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all this defensive retreat General Johnston
had not lost property to the value of a cracker
box. While the country we had so far advanced
over had been most favorable to a defensive
campaign, nevertheless, I doubt if the history of
the world can furnish another example of so
well executed defensive work, as that conducted
by General Joseph E. Johnston, from Ringgold
to the Chattahoochee river. But fortunately for
the right treason is not always associated with
great ability. If the civil administration of the
confederacy had been conducted as ably as the
military, with all of its mistakes and blunders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the outcome would have been a matter of grave
doubt. But fortunately for the Union and the
cause of humanity, Mr. Jefferson Davis, the
president of the confederacy, had not the
ability to appreciate the services of one so
able as the general that had so successfully
opposed General Sherman on the Atlanta campaign.
Generals Johnston and Sherman were
both educated at our military academy at West
Point, and were classmates. Each knew the
other very well; and it was the plan of General
Johnston, knowing the impetuosity of General
Sherman, to destroy the union army by suffering
it to continually give him battle behind his impregnable
works, and from which continual mistakes
General Sherman's able lieutenants had
saved him (to which I have referred heretofore).
General Johnston well knew, from the start, that
he could not cope with the union army in an
open field engagement, and he had planned to
have so reduced Sherman's army, by the time
he had reached and crossed the Chattahoochee
river, that the two armies would be on something
like equal terms as to men, and a more
aggressive mode of warfare on the part of the
rebel forces would give better promise of
success. But after the confederate army had
crossed the Chattahoochee river, the civil authorities
at Richmond became alarmed. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>president of the confederacy being the inspiration
of the dissatisfaction that existed against
General Sherman's heroic opponent, General
Johnston was removed and General Hood
placed in command of the rebel forces, and
the sequel will show with what success. Had
General Johnston been supported by the civil
authorities at Richmond, as the good (or bad
rather) of the confederate cause demanded, in
my humble judgment, the music and sentiment
of "Marching through Georgia," that so much
amused the grand old general in his declining
years, would never have been written. But I
must stop this generalizing and return to the
details of my narrative.</p>

<p class='c000'>July 10th, 1864, again found us on the march
to the left, and we moved in that direction about
seven miles to near the headquarters of the 23d
Corps, and on the twelfth, again struck tents,
and moved down to the river, crossing the same
on a canvas-boat pontoon bridge, and went into
camp much nearer Atlanta than ever before.
The next day we were again on the move, but
only made a short distance and went into camp,
and remained in camp until the seventeenth,
when our brigade went to the river above, drove
the Johnnies away, and saw one of General
Sherman's pontoon companies put a bridge
across the Chattahoochee river in just one hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>and a quarter, and the 14th Army Corps commenced
crossing. The next day we broke camp
and started in the direction of Atlanta, General
Newton's division taking the lead. We found
nothing but skirmishers before us, who seemed
entirely willing to fall back as fast as we came
on. The next day, the nineteenth, we moved
up to Peach Tree creek, and we found that a
different commander was in charge of the rebels,
for they attacked the 20th Corps with great
spirit. But it did not seem to take the heroes
of Lookout mountain long in an open field
fight to do the Johnnies, as they seemed to be
very glad to get away from them. This battle
of Peach Tree creek was the first of Hood's
battles, and in this he was very badly punished.
Our regiment was not engaged more than in
heavy skirmishing, but our captain, Sherburn B.
Eaton, was badly, and in fact very dangerously,
wounded. He was serving on staff duty at
division headquarters at the time. The captain
recovered from his wound, but not sufficiently
to permit of his returning to the service. Captain
Eaton was our first adjutant, and was as
prompt an one as ever read orders on dress
parade. He was a very scholarly gentleman,
and from him we learned much; and if I remember
correctly he learned some things from us.
Some of us country boys, on the start, thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>our adjutant a little stylish; but we found him
brave in action, and that, like charity, covers a
multitude of other seeming defects in a soldier.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Sam. Beatty's brigade of our division
captured a large number of men, and among
them a number of officers. Though the burden
of the battle of Peach Tree creek fell on Hooker's
Corps, many other organizations bore quite
important parts in the same. On the whole, we
were all highly pleased with the change in the
rebel commanders, and hoped he would keep
up his present tactics. This open-field-battle
business was just what we wanted, and had
been praying for all summer, and only hoped
Corporal Hood would indulge in them to
excess.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twentieth of July we marched to the
left, our division supporting the first division to
within three miles of Decatur, and within four
miles of Atlanta. Very heavy skirmishing in
front, and McPherson reported within two miles
of Atlanta. Hood charged Newton's division
and Hooker's Corps, and was repulsed with
great loss.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twenty-first we broke camp very early,
moved to the right, crossed the Peach Tree
creek, moved to the front, and put up good
works.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early the morning of the twenty-second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Hardee's Corps moved back to the east of
Decatur, and struck McPherson's Corps on the
left flank and rear, completely turning the same.
The gallant general was killed at the front where
he was trying to rearrange his line of battle,
exposing himself to the enemy's sharpshooters.
We all felt that all the brave general could have
accomplished by his exposure was very poor
recompense for the grand life thus sacrificed.
Everything seemed to promise victory for the
rebels until they had swept our line as far as the
15th Corps, when they found that Logan had
changed his front to rear, and instead of there
being anything like panic or confusion, they
were met by a charge, led in person by that gallant
general, that sent them whirling back to the
place from which they started, leaving Logan in
possession of the field. We were moved over
to the left to the support of the 15th Corps, but
were not put into the action; and I think could
not have been without being mounted, such was
the fury of Logan's charge. This was the third of
Corporal Hood's battles before Atlanta, each one
of which had resulted in defeat and great disaster.
But our loss was terribly severe, as we lost
one of our best corps commanders, which cast a
gloom over the entire army. General James
McPherson was not only loved by the army of
the Tennessee, but was admired by all the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and officers that were so fortunate as to have
formed his acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twenty-second we advanced our lines
nearer the city and threw up very heavy intrenchments,
and the next day strengthened
them and put up a line of abatis in front. Our
batteries spent their time in throwing shells into
the city. I should say our skirmish line was out
a mile from the ridge occupied by our works.
We remained in this position for a number of
days, and on the twenty-seventh moved out and
marched around a hill to the left, seemingly a
thousand and one times, to make the rebels
believe we were moving to the left; but I guess
we did not fool them much, as I never saw that
anything ever came out of our demonstration.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this position, at the left of our regiment
and company, there was a battery of ten pound
Rodman guns posted. These guns were rifled
and were capable of throwing a shell five miles,
they made us believe at least, and they spent
their time throwing shells into Atlanta. Once
every five minutes they dropped a shell into the
city, which must have rendered it a very unpleasant
place for a summer resort. The strangest
thing about this whole business is, that we could
lie down and go to sleep "in our little beds,"
and not hear those five minute guns <em>once</em> all
night long. Such is the power of habit.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>At this position we received news that Sergeant
Japhet Sooy had died at Chattanooga the
sixteenth of July. Sergeant Sooy was one of
the best of soldiers, and his great mirthfulness
not only made him a great favorite with his own
company, but with the entire regiment. All
knew him to be brave and kind, as well as faithful
and obedient. We also received word that
Timothy Powers was buried at Chattanooga the
twenty-eighth of July.</p>

<p class='c000'>The news of these sad losses caused us to
reflect on the condition of Company B that left
Cleveland, Ohio, with one hundred strong and
able-bodied men. Now twenty-five of them
were under the ground, filling honorable, but
many of them unknown, graves. I have not the
record now before me, but I am certain that the
other nine companies of this fighting regiment
suffered equally as severe losses.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the third of August the skirmish line in
the front of our brigade left their pits, drove the
rebel skirmish line back, and captured thirty of
the Johnnies; and so persistently did our fellows
hold the advanced position by them taken, that
the rebels had to bring up a line of battle before
they could restore their skirmish line. In this
affair our regiment did not lose a man. This
little action came about by our general officers
thinking there were no rebels but a skirmish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>line in our front, and there was nothing to hinder
us from going to Atlanta; but they soon
found out there were plenty of those selfsame
rebels between our line and the city we sought.
We remained in this position a long time, doing
more camp than field duty. General Sherman
brought up a number of heavy siege guns from
the rear and planted them to our right, and
threw one hundred pounds of iron into the city
at every discharge. What good this bombardment
did I cannot now tell, save the destruction
of a rebel city, which I have now come to regard
as the right thing to do under the circumstances,
and should have been commenced
sooner. Somehow rebel cities seemed to suffer
wherever General Sherman went, for which
I entertain for his memory the profoundest respect.</p>

<p class='c000'>While at Atlanta we lost the 9th Ind. from
our brigade. Colonel Campbell had orders to
report to Indianapolis for muster-out. We were
sorry to part with the 9th as they were in every
respect a first-class regiment, and could be
always depended upon to take care of their part
of the line. But they were now going home,
after serving since 1861, having done their full
share of service for their country.</p>

<p class='c000'>August 26th, at about eight o'clock a. m., we
commenced the movement to the right. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>was the most terribly hot weather we had encountered;
we marched not over eight miles,
but more than half of our regiment fell out, completely
overcome by the intense heat. That night
our regiment was ordered on the skirmish line.
The next day the regiment was ordered to move
to the right, and marched about four miles. The
next day the 14th Corps and its train passed us,
and the general tendency of the army seemed to
be to the right. The next day we struck what we
called the Montgomery railroad. We destroyed
about a mile of it pretty effectually. We turned
the road over, built large fires, put in the rails,
heated them hot, and then twisted them around
trees and stumps. I have since thought of what
sort of language the section-boss used, when he
was sent to repair that track. I wonder if what
we did that day made the confessional more
expensive for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>August 30th we moved out early, to a position
near where we had been wrecking railroad; then
marched in a southeasterly course to within four
miles of the Macon railroad, as we called it at
the time. We were offered very little resistance
from the enemy, and this day we marched about
ten miles. We were making the grand flank
movement around Atlanta, so famous in history.
On the last day of August we moved out from
camp to a position on a ridge, and commenced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>putting up works. Plenty of enemy in our
front. About eleven o'clock a. m. the rebels left
their works, and we immediately started in pursuit.
The 1st division took some prisoners.
We struck the Macon railroad about four o'clock
p. m. We saw a train pass over the road just as
we came up. We selected a position and fortified
it, and a detail destroyed the track. The
next morning, our brigade being in the rear, we
moved out late and marched down the railroad
toward Jonesborough. Heavy cannonading at
the front, and we learned that the regular brigade
had made an assault on the enemy's
position and had been repulsed; but we were
also informed that General Mitchell's brigade
had renewed the assault, drove the rebels from
their works, captured a six gun battery and two
thousand prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the second day of September, 1864, we
moved out early, marched through Jonesborough,
and found the enemy in position about
three miles south of town on the railroad. We
formed in line of battle, and made an attack on
both his flanks, but failed, for some reason, to
pass beyond them. Here we learned that Atlanta
had fallen and was in our possession, and the
rejoicing along our line was immense. The
news was soon confirmed by a circular from
division headquarters, stating that the rebels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>had blown up two of their trains of ammunition
and seven siege guns. This accounted for the
noise, that sounded more like an explosion than
a battle, that we had heard the night before. For
some reason entirely unknown to your humble
servant, General Sherman did not desire to
pursue Corporal Hood any further south, and
our line of battle was withdrawn. So Atlanta
had fallen after a campaign of one hundred and
twenty-two days. The distance from Chattanooga
to Atlanta by the railroad is one hundred
and thirty-eight miles, but we had marched, undoubtedly,
more than that distance by a great
many miles, in the flank movements we had
made.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the eighth day of September, 1864, we
marched into and through the "gate city of the
south." We put on all the style of which our
dirty and ragged condition would permit, forming
our regiments in column by company, with
our bands playing and colors flying. We
marched down Marietta street, and the few
citizens we saw did not lay themselves out to
give us a cordial welcome. This street was the
nearest <em>ruins</em> of anything west of the Atlantic.
We saw one large sign that I suppose the
visitor could hardly find in the new Atlanta. It
extended the entire front of a block and read:
"Slaves At Auction." We marched three miles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>east of town and went into camp, and the
Atlanta campaign was ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have tried to give you, though very imperfectly,
my recollections of this, the greatest campaign
ever made on the western continent. To
the general hearer it would have been more
interesting, without doubt, to have given the
outlines of the campaign, omitting the details of
each day's movements with their dates; but as
many of that old fighting regiment (of which I
had the honor of being a member) are still alive,
I thought it my duty to place upon record a
detailed account of their sufferings and triumphs.
General Sherman had, indeed, broken the shell
of the confederacy; but I must say (and I think
my comrades will agree with me) it was, by all
odds, the <em>toughest shell</em> we ever helped to crack.</p>

<p class='c000'>For more than one hundred days, of the one
hundred and twenty-two days of the Atlanta
campaign, we had been under fire. The graves
of our dear dead comrades are scattered thickly
from Dalton to Jonesborough.</p>

<p class='c000'>The red earth of our intrenchments marks the
hillsides and beautiful mountains of northern
and central Georgia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The campaign was the severest blow the
rebellion had received up to that time, and from
Atlanta, General Sherman commenced his grand
march to the sea.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>FROM ATLANTA TO NASHVILLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The campaign of Atlanta practically closed
with the abandonment of the city by the rebels,
September 2d, 1864. The confederate forces
still occupied a position near Jonesborough,
about thirty miles south of Atlanta. The campaign
had ended by the federal forces arriving
at a certain geographical point. The confederate
forces, although somewhat shattered and reduced
by the battles dating from Peach Tree
creek forward, were still intact. The rebel forces
were still in command of Hood; and with him
were some able fighting officers, in the persons
of Cleburne, Hill, Hardee, Adams and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>On our arrival at Atlanta, General Sherman
immediately commenced preparations for the
grand march to the sea. It was at once evident
that he intended to abandon his line of communications,
for he commenced to build a fort large
enough for the garrison he intended to leave at
Atlanta. This fort he built substantially in the
heart of the city, and destroyed the balance because
in the way of the fort. So when General
Sherman took up his world-renowned march for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the seaboard, but very little of the "gate city of
the south" remained standing. While these
preparations were going forward the 124th regiment
was in camp about three miles southeast
of Atlanta, busy in cleaning up, drawing new
clothing, and recuperating from the effects of the
arduous campaign just closed. We had not
been in camp many days before we were astonished
by the news that the Sanitary Commission,
a patriotic organization of the loyal citizens of
the north (whose ramifications penetrated to
every city, village, hamlet and farm of the loyal
states), had sent us a train load of Irish potatoes.
This may seem a small matter to take note of
after so many years and read to you, who in all
your lives have never know the want of anything
to eat your appetites might crave, but what do
you say of a lot of men that from January 1st,
1863, to September, 1864, had not feasted, even
their eyes, on a potato? If you could, at your
home, surrounded with all the delicacies of the
culinary art, be deprived of the common potato
for eighteen months, you could then appreciate
our situation. The cheers and shouting that
went up, mid-afternoon, when the commissary
department sent word to the regiments it had
potatoes to issue, were enough to make one think
the news of some great victory had been communicated
to us. And when the stream of potatoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>began to be diverted and divided to the
companies and messes, it was too comical for
anything, those great bronzed and weather-beaten
soldiers, running around with their hands
full of potatoes, and to see the fires lighted at
that time of day, and the little kettles, or pails
rather, filled and put on brimming full of potatoes;
then when cooled to see the feasting—potatoes
served with salt. I suppose you would
demand nice Jersey butter, but salt was good
enough for us. And this is not all I have to say
of that commission organized from the loyal citizens
of the north. It brought us by the car
load, pickled cabbage and onions; and how refreshing
they were to us that had not tasted vegetable
food for eighteen long months. I do not
believe there is an old veteran alive to-day that
does not bless from the bottom of his heart, that
greatest and most magnificent of charities ever
organized—the Sanitary Commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had stayed in camp, as I said, while General
Sherman was preparing for his march to the
sea; busy each day with drilling, foraging for
corn, and all the many things necessary to keep
companies and regiments in good shape, as per
the army regulations. We had hoped, as had
each regiment of the Army of the Cumberland,
that it would be our good fortune to go with
Sherman on his march south, and it was with not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>a little chagrin and heartburning that we were
not called, neither chosen, to go on that march,
that has been the wonder and admiration of the
military critics of all nations.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been determined by General Sherman
that our corps (the 4th), commanded by General
Stanley, and the 23d Corps, commanded by General
Schofield—these two corps, and all other
organizations of troops between Atlanta and
Nashville, to be in command of General George
H. Thomas. Howard was placed in command of
the army of the Tennessee, whereby we lost the
services of General Hooker. The remainder of
the army (save the brigade of regulars, that were
sent back to the top of Lookout mountain where
they would be out of danger) was chosen by
General Sherman to make the march to the sea.
But you must not suppose that this choice was
made by reason of any superiority of that portion
of the army that went with him. It had
turned out that Corporal Hood had made up his
mind that if Sherman could cut away from his
base of supplies, and march south into the enemy's
country, he (Hood) ought to be able to
march north, among his dearly beloved friends;
and if Sherman struck a heavy blow south, he
would get in his counter up north. And with
the 23d and 4th Corps only, left by Sherman,
Hood had two men to Thomas' one.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>But before passing to the details of the campaign
upon which we were about to enter, suffer
me to remark that the same painstaking preparation
by General Sherman that I referred to in
the "Atlanta Campaign," was going forward.
The most rigid surgical examination was had in
every company of every man whose health was
suspected, or where there could be anything
found that incapacitated him from performing
the supposed arduous duties to be imposed upon
him. All that could not stand this rigid test
were sent north. Would you not suppose that
many would have taken advantage of this examination
to have gotten rid of a campaign that
seemed fraught with dangers, and so difficult of
execution? On the contrary, I am informed
by high authority that those that were rejected
felt themselves grossly insulted and degraded as
soldiers. Neither was this crucial examination
confined to the men—the animals were carefully
inspected, and all those not perfectly sound were
sent to the rear, or disposed of in some other
way. The same of arms and accouterments; so
that when General Sherman turned his face
toward the salt sea breezes of the Atlantic, he
had under his command as hardy, as healthy, as
determined, and as brave an army of veterans
as ever caused the earth to tremble under their
tread.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>It now seemed that Hood wanted a little more
of the smell of our powder before he took his
little excursion to the mountains of Tennessee,
for we heard he was in force north of Marietta,
and was threatening one of our fortified positions
at Altoona Pass, that Sherman had used
as a sub-base of supplies during the Atlanta
campaign. So October 3d, 1864, we broke up
camp and marched to within five miles of Marietta,
and camped in the rebel works that had
been constructed by them, first, after leaving
their position at Kennesaw mountain. This was
good marching, having started from our camp,
three miles east of Atlanta, at four o'clock p. m.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourth, we struck tents at noon and
marched through Marietta to the front of Kennesaw,
and again found the rebel works convenient.
Plenty of rebels reported at Big Shanty,
a short distance north. This two days' marching
shows how much easier to retrograde than to
advance, in the face of the enemy. It had taken
us to go from Kennesaw mountain to Atlanta,
from July 22d to September 2d, and we had returned
in a part of two days. The fifth we
moved out of our camp and marched north to
Piny Knob, and formed in line of battle along
the base of the mountain. Sherman had a signal
corps or station on the top of this mountain.
Some of us went up to the station, and we could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>distinctly see Altoona Pass, and see the smoke
of the battle in progress there, as well as watch
the advancing columns General Sherman was
sending forward for the relief of General Corse,
who was gallantly defending the works there,
against overpowering numbers of the enemy.
It was here, from this mountain top, that General
Sherman signaled to General Corse "Hold
the fort for I am coming," that some one has
immortalized in sacred song. Several of the old
124th stood not twenty feet from the old general,
when this famous dispatch was being signaled
from the top of Piny Knob to the gallant Corse,
who at that time was suffering from a dangerous
wound he received while in the defense he was
making. But Hood, evidently, did not care to
fight on equal terms, and withdrew in the direction
of Lost mountain, and afterwards moved
in the direction of Rome, Ga.; and Sherman,
leaving Old Pap Thomas to look after and care
for Corporal Hood, turned his face toward the
south, and that was the last day of the war we
ever saw our beloved Uncle Billy. It was with
a feeling of sadness that we saw him depart, for
we had learned to love and trust in him as we
had no other commander. We marched north
through Altoona Pass, which still showed evidences
of the sanguinary conflict that had taken
place there. We marched all night after we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>went through the Pass, sleeping fifteen minutes
each hour. It was perfectly surprising to see
how quickly the regiment would go to sleep
when the halt was sounded. When the assembly
call came it was some trouble to wake the
tired soldiers, but usually we were soon all in
line, and marching on for another hour. The
next day we marched all day long, after halting,
making coffee, and taking breakfast near the
Etowah river. On this march I first discovered
the fact that it was possible for one to march and
be sound asleep, for on waking up I discovered
that no portion of the landscape had a familiar
look, showing that one had been asleep long
enough for the landscape to entirely change by
our moving forward. This marching back on
the railroad track was very hard, as the road was
not in very good shape, and we were in danger
of falling through trestles; and during the night,
every now and then, some sleepy soldier would
get off his guard, and his head would go down
on the rail, making everything jingle. All the
sympathy such unfortunates received would be
the shouts and jeers of his comrades to which
he often replied in language <em>just bordering on
the profane</em>. This marching did not differ much
from day to day, and on the fifteenth day of
October we crossed the Rocky Face mountains.
We went out over the Chickamauga battlefield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>and saw very many of the bones of our unknown
comrades still unburied, that had fallen there
more than a year before.</p>

<p class='c000'>What strange feelings come over one as he
passes over the field where he fought, and his
loved comrades fell. It seems as though they
were with him again in all of their manly beauty;
he can see their stern looks of defiance; can hear
the rattle of the musketry, the thunder of the
artillery, the shouts of victory, the thud of the
fatal minie, the dying groan, the last good-bye;
and the specter battle seems as real as when
engaged in the deadly conflict of the year before.
The timber was badly torn down by the shot
and shells on that portion of the field over which
we passed. I remember the last day our Colonel
Payne was with us. The regiment was marching
left in front that day, and of course that
brought my company next to the colonel and his
staff. We made a halt near Rossville, and laid
down on the grass to rest. It was a beautiful
Indian summer evening; and while in conversation
with the colonel he informed me he intended
to leave the regiment at Chattanooga; "thought
he had done his part," which was true, having
nearly lost his life from a wound he received at
Chickamauga. I was surprised to learn of his
intention to leave us, as this was the first intimation
that I had of his intention to resign; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>what surprised me most was the despairing view
he seemed to take of the war. He said to me,
"We never can conquer the south, and if we do
children yet unborn will fight in this war." I
replied: "They would have to muster them in
pretty young, if they did, and I expect to see
the end of the rebellion the next year." I think
it must have been the depressing effect of our
retrograde movement that had taken such a hold
on our brave young colonel, for it did seem to
many that all our arduous campaign to Atlanta
had been for naught.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many thought it presumptuous in General
Sherman to leave a large rebel army to be
opposed by an army of about half its numbers.
But General Sherman knew him that was in
command of the rebel army, and knew very well
the grand old Virginian he had intrusted with
the taking care of him. We went into camp
around Chattanooga, the place that had been the
scene of so much of sorrow and rejoicing the
year before. We soon heard that Hood was
marching for the Tennessee river about Decatur,
and we were put into and on freight cars, and
started in the night for that point.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large part of my company was on the top
of the cars, and many of them went to sleep in
that dangerous situation and caused me very
much anxiety. Many a time during that night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>of peril I found a comrade just on the edge of
the car, liable to fall off with any little jolt. I
never remember passing a more perilous night.
The next day we "came off the roof" of the cars,
and soon commenced the march northward for
Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we came to the Duck river, that we had
crossed the year before at Manchester, there a
mere mountain stream, we found a considerable
river, and so swollen with rains that it gave us
considerable difficulty in crossing. We soon
arrived at Pulaski, a beautiful little village in
middle Tennessee. This is the best portion of
the state, and so much has nature done for it,
that had it not been for the blighting influence of
slavery, might have truthfully been denominated
the garden spot of the United States. We had
not been in Pulaski many days before Forrest's
cavalry appeared on our flanks, and we heard
that Hood had crossed the Tennessee river.
We now took the pike again and moved up as
far as the village of Columbia, the home of several
distinguished officers of the confederate
army. Here we went into camp, and did considerable
intrenching, our flanks resting on the
Elk river. We arrived at Columbia the twenty-fourth
of October, and remained there until the
night of the twenty-ninth. During the day of
the twenty-ninth our regiment was sent up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>river to watch a ford, and we watched it nicely,
seeing the rebel infantry crossing all day; but we
had no orders to do anything but watch. That
afternoon we heard heavy firing in the direction
of Spring Hill, and we afterwards learned that
our first division had been sharply engaged with
Cheatham's division, and had most handsomely
checked the rebel advance. At dark we were
called in, and commenced the march northward
again. I should say it was about midnight when
Adjutant Hammer came riding back directing the
company commandants to have the men so adjust
their canteens and bayonet scabbards that as
little noise be made as possible, that we were in
the immediate presence of the enemy. This we
could hardly believe. Were it possible that the
rebels had gotten a position cutting our army in
twain? We believed nothing of the kind, but,
nevertheless, obeyed the order like the true veteran
soldiers that we were. Soon we saw two
lines of fires running away to the northeast, and
the left end of the line nearest us was so near
the pike one could have cast a stone into it without
much effort. Were it possible these two
lines of bivouac fires represented the two lines
of blue and gray that had been fighting there
the afternoon before? It was true. Such were
the facts. And yet our division, the 3d, and a
wagon train twelve miles long, passed along that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>pike, with all the noise incident to the moving
of a wagon train and artillery attached to our
division, without hindrance or molestation from
the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a shot was fired, not a rebel picket nor
skirmish line encountered, as we passed the left
flank of the enemy's line. Yet, they knew we
were there, for several of our men wandered
from the column and went over to the fires to
warm, and were captured. Was there treason
to the confederacy? The fighting the next day
fully answers that question in the negative.
Hood claims, I am told, that his officers were
drunk and failed to attack as he had ordered,
and thereby let our division pass him at Spring
Hill. This may be true, for middle Tennessee
makes a kind of whiskey that will take the W. C.
T. U. a long time to eradicate. A single skirmish
line across the pike that night would have
so delayed us, incumbered with the train, as we
were (the train could not have been moved off
the pike), that it hardly seems possible that
General Stanley could have reunited the divisions
of his corps. Thus was the golden opportunity
of Hood lost. We soon left the rebel
fires behind us, and with our train well ahead,
and our divisions united, we had little to fear
from an army commanded by such a general
as Hood. I have read somewhere a confederate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>account of this transaction, and the writer,
though claiming to have been on the spot, fails
to give anything like a rational reason for the
confederate forces letting us pass them October
30th, at Spring Hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning we halted and made coffee
beside the pike. While breakfasting, a squad of
rebel cavalry dashed up to the train, fired a few
shots, and were away like the wind. As we
neared Franklin we came up with some new
regiments that General Thomas had hurried on
from Nashville, to meet and assist us in case we
were forced to a battle before we reached Nashville.
These poor fellows that had been as far
south as Spring Hill, and were returning that
morning, were mostly completely played out, and
filled the fence corners all along the pike. I am
sorry to say the hardy veterans that swung along
after marching all night treated them to expressions
of which the following are samples: "Fresh
fish." "Fresh fish." "There lies $1000 and a
cow." "How much did you get?" "Say Jimmy,
who owns you?" "Millions in it." These poor
fellows, with knapsacks larger than a mule
should be required to carry, received these
taunts and jeers with silent disgust; and quite
likely the most of them at this time are drawing
pensions for disabilities received in the service
and in the line of duty, while the old veteran of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>scores of battles and skirmishes, of hundreds of
miles of marches, though broken in health, and
prematurely old by reason of his hard service,
<em>has no hospital record</em>, and suffers great difficulties
in establishing his claim for a pension.
Something wrong, somewhere, sure.</p>

<p class='c000'>We arrived at Franklin about noon, and found
the 23d Corps in position and throwing up works
from the Harpeth river above the village to the
river below. With this place we were very
familiar. We first came here in February, 1863.
This was our camp of instruction. We assisted
in building the fort, with its large magazine on
the north side of the river and to the left of the
village facing south. We that had worked out
many a weary detail asking, "What is all this
worth?" "What is this for, miles—miles from
the enemy and the front," had the opportunity,
this thirtieth day of October, 1864, of seeing our
labor richly rewarded. We use to do picket
duty north of the river and town, and knew
every foot of that country; and our Lieutenant
Colonel Pickands and Adjutant Hammer enjoyed
the reputation of knowing some of the
rebel girls, with which the village swarmed. I
remembered one Sally Atkinson, who lived near
our picket line, in fact the line ran through her
father's dooryard, who was a fine player on the
piano, and something of a singer. She, like all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>the southern women, was a bitter rebel, and
used to entertain the boys with "The bonny
blue flag," and other rebel songs. She often
boasted of having two brothers in the rebel
service. But more of this anon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our wagon train was on the north side of the
river, pulling out for Nashville to the full extent
of its mule power. Those not familiar may be
interested in a brief description of the field
where the battle of Franklin was fought. The
Harpeth river makes quite a sharp bend to the
north, and the formerly very rich village, built
very compactly, occupies the most of the room
in the bend. Here, before the war, was the
home of many rich cotton planters, for as you
all will remember, this is the heart of the cotton
growing belt of Tennessee. The turnpike running
from the southern part of the state, through
Pulaski, Columbia, and on to Nashville, ran
through about the center of Franklin. The
Harpeth river is a small stream, made largely
of springs, but running through a limestone
region, lay in deep pools much of its way, that
only rendered it fordable above and below the
town. To the left of the pike going south from
town there was a large cotton field, stretching
to the left, nearly to the river, and extending to
the south, I should say, from half to three-quarters
of a mile to a line of hills, that rise quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>abruptly and constitute a picturesque landscape.
Across this cotton field, from east to west, ran
our works, as I have said, from river above to
river below. At and near the pike, and to the left
of the same, was planted all of the field artillery
that we possessed. It was the fortune of our
regiment to be detailed to cross the river, go
down below the pike bridge, intrench the south
bank and guard the ford; and while we witnessed
the battle we were not called into it, and
did not have occasion to fire a shot at the point
where we were stationed. Our line, as you will
understand from this brief description, was of
necessity short, and in some places was supported
by a reserve line. General Hood came
up with his forces and formed his charging
columns under the cover of the hills at the
south. He visited each division and brigade,
to which he stated that all the confederate
soldiers had to do was to take the rude works
in front of Franklin, Thomas' army would be
captured, and Nashville with all of its vast military
stores of clothing, provisions and ammunition
would fall into their hands. That Hood
was a good man to fight, about a division, I
think is conceded; but I take it, if Thomas had
been consulted, and could have had the directing
of Hood, he would not have had him done any
different from what he did. Hood had in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>arms, about forty-five thousand men when he
came before Franklin. He had about six thousand
cavalry, under General Forrest, that instead
of using on our flanks and rear, he sent
off to Murfreesborough to take the fort that
was garrisoned by a few regiments of recent enlistment.
The fort was easily defended against
Forrest and would have been had his force been
double what it was. Forrest was a raider, but
in no sense a fighter. Schofield had not more
than twenty thousand men, all told, some of
which were on duty with the train. But twenty
thousand old veterans, as my old soldier
friends will bear me witness here to-day, are
hard to go out and get, especially, if you
come straight up to the front door, and this
Corporal Hood, in a very gentlemanly manner,
did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hood formed his charging column in three
lines, extending across the old cotton field from
east to west; his right reaching the river, his left
resting on the pike. About three o'clock he
made his first assault. His lines came on in fine
style. The heavy guns in the fort commenced
shelling unmercifully as soon as the assaulting
column emerged from behind the hills, and when
it reached a point near enough the field artillery
opened with shrapnel and canister, making fearful
havoc in the ranks of gray. But nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>daunted those charging lines, led by that best of
fighting generals, Pat Cleburne, came on until
they reached a point within two hundred yards
of our works, when our infantry opened such a
murderous fire over that level field that no valor
could stand before its destructive torrent. The
assaulting column broke, and the personal presence
of Hood and his daring lieutenant could
not rally them until they were behind the sheltering
protection of the hills where they were
first formed. The assault was repeated time
after time, until nine o'clock that night. In one
of these assaults the rebels charged to our
works and drove our first line out of them for a
short distance; but Colonel Opdyke's brigade,
lying close in the rear, at once charged, restoring
the line and capturing over a thousand prisoners.
The rebels were taken entirely unawares
by the charge made by Opdyke's brigade.
When they captured that portion of the line
they seemed to think our forces had left, for
Opdyke found them sitting down on the top of
the works; some of them, having laid their guns
aside and lighted their pipes, were enjoying the
<em>solace of the soldier</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our field artillery did most magnificent work,
but suffered heavily. One battery of the Ohio
regiment of artillery lost all the men it had at
one gun, save a sergeant, and he loaded and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>gave the charging column one dose of canister
after his left arm had been blown off.</p>

<p class='c000'>This battle of Franklin was one of the most
sanguinary, and to the rebel army one of the
most disastrous, of the war. Hood lost four
general officers, among them was the celebrated
Pat Cleburne, that our division had been
opposed to so many times on the Atlanta campaign.
He fell in one of the many charges that
afternoon, his horse's fore legs resting on our
works. As soon as it was certain that the enemy
did not intend to renew the conflict that night,
our troops began to retire to the south side of
the river. The bridge across the stream was
covered with blankets to a depth of six or
eight inches, and the artillery was moved across
without noise; and by two o'clock a. m. of the
thirty-first of October the last regiment was on
the south side of the river and on the march for
Nashville. Our wounded were left in the village,
those that could not be moved, and surgeons
to take care of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>About two o'clock that morning Colonel
Pickands came to our company and said "he
had orders to leave one company in the position
our regiment had occupied during the battle,
and concluded that company B must be the
one." The order was, "that we stay at the ford
until orders were received to abandon it;" said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>"he would send back an orderly to notify us
when we could leave;" said, "we might all be
captured," and he bade me an affectionate farewell
when he rode away. If any one doubts
that this was an anxious hour for us, he does not
duly appreciate the situation. It would have
been nothing for mounted men, but we were
footmen and expected the enemy would send
out a squadron of cavalry at daybreak to ascertain
what had become of those that had punished
them so the day before. We listened to the last
footfall until it died away up the stone pike
toward Nashville, then all was still. I then went
along the line and told each one of the boys
that when we were relieved, or if attacked before
the order came, we would about-face and move
back in our present order, deployed as skirmishers.
About three-fourths of a mile to the
south on a gentle elevation was a poplar grove,
and I insisted to the boys that if we could maintain
our line, in case of an attack, either before
or after the order of relief came, we could make
a splendid fight even against cavalry in those
woods. I knew I could rely upon the boys. I
knew any 124th man could be relied upon during
the war—and since. Then we had nothing
to do but wait. Not a sound was heard across
the river in Franklin, in the direction of the
enemy. Sodom and Gomorrah were not stiller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>after they received the sulphurous shower, than
was that intensely rebel village and their friends
near the hills beyond. The day-god began to
streak the east with his golden rays, and still
no order came. No cheerful cockcrowing was
heard as a harbinger of the dawning day. The
last rooster in the confederacy had been eliminated
long years before. Day began to break,
and we strained our eyes up and down the river
and in the direction of Franklin, to see the
approaching foe, but all was still as death.
Had we been forgotten? Had something happened
to the orderly? What good could we do
by staying? But the order was imperative,
"stay until ordered away," and orders must be
obeyed, even if the brave men on this severe
duty were relegated to captivity. It was now
broad daylight, and no orderly in sight. But
no rebel cavalry in sight either. The situation
was strangely interesting in the extreme. All
at once we heard the ringing clatter of a horse's
hoofs, and looking up the pike—coming down
the hill at breakneck pace—<em>came the orderly at
last</em>. Talk about sweet strains of music—not
Theodore Thomas' orchestra, rendering one of
Beethoven's symphonies, could ever sound as
sweetly as the ringing of those hoof-beats on
that limestone pike that October morning.
Riding up to me he said: "Captain, remove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>your men," and turning his steed toward Nashville
was soon out of sight over the hill. We
immediately began to <em>remove</em>. The order was
obeyed, not only with willingness, but with
wonderous alacrity. We double-quicked in
line until we came to the poplar grove, when
we, seeing no signs of pursuit, came into column
on the pike, and with a long step toward the
front, and a sharp lookout toward the rear, we
rapidly measured off the miles in the direction
of Nashville. About eight o'clock that morning
we came up with the rear guard, and soon the
balance of the regiment, making coffee and
breakfasting by the road side. We were greeted
by the colonel and the regiment with exclamations
of joy. I told the colonel I was afraid he
had forgotten us, but he insisted we had not
been out of his mind a minute since he left us,
which I have no doubt was true. But when the
facts came to be known, we were not in the least
danger. Had we known at that time that old
Corporal Hood had so kindly sent all of his
cavalry away to Murfreesborough, where they
could do him no good, and us no possible harm,
we would have stayed, made coffee, and eaten
breakfast before starting. In fact, I have no
doubt some of the boys would have been over
in the village looking for "Robinson County,"
where they used to find it while on picket
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>months before. But, all in all, a portion of the
old 124th were the last union soldiers to leave
Franklin, after the bloody battle of the thirtieth
of October, 1864.</p>

<p class='c000'>But war has its sad features, even for an
enemy as dishonorable and as thoroughly hated
as were the rebels. The beautiful village of
Franklin was riddled with shot and shell. The
great cotton field to the south was thickly
covered with the graves of the confederate soldiers.
The two brothers of the sweet singer of
rebel songs were both killed within a few rods
of their dear old home. But on the other hand,
Miss Sally Atkinson, after the war, <em>became the
kind and loving wife of an officer on General
Thomas' staff, emblematical of the restored
Union</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thirty-first we marched to Nashville, and
the first of December took our position on the
line extending around the city, from the Tennessee
above to the river below. The line was
a long one and necessarily thin. Everything
was in a bustle of excitement in the city. Hood
was expected to arrive and invest the city every
hour. The gunboats were busy puffing up and
down the river looking after the flanks of our
lines and the various fords above and below.
Every soldier in the hospitals that could possibly
perform duty was sent to the front. All the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>laborers that were enlisted as such, and everyone
that could use a pick and shovel, was pressed
into the service and set at work on the intrenchments.
Every private horse in the city was
taken for the cavalry or artillery. The right of
ownership of private property, as applied to
horseflesh, was in no sense respected. Dan Castello's
circus was performing at Nashville at the
time, and every horse was confiscated. Mrs.
Lake's celebrated trick horse, Czar, was the only
one left, and that was undoubtedly owing to the
feeling of chivalry every true soldier has for a
lady. We had been in Nashville two days, I
think, when Hood came up very leisurely and
formed his lines well out from ours. He did
not act like business, and evidently had not
recovered from the terrible drubbing he had
received at Franklin. It was now midwinter in
the climate of Tennessee, the mud was deep,
and it rained and sleeted almost every day.
Hood did not even ask for a skirmish, and his
was the saddest army of investment that ever
encompassed a city. General Thomas was busy
issuing clothing to his army, and especially
shoes, as our foot gear had been sadly demoralized
by the long march over stony roads and
railway tracks back from Atlanta. Our portion
of the line ran in front of the Acklin Place, a
charming villa residence, built at an expense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>a million and a half of dollars. The owner was
a Mr. Acklin, a wealthy Englishman, who, at his
own expense, fully armed and equipped a regiment
of confederate infantry, named for him
"The Acklin Rifles." This Mr. Acklin <em>was not
at home</em>, so General Thomas took his spacious
mansion for corps and division headquarters. I
am satisfied that never before was army headquarters
so ornamented with such paintings and
marbles. We, on the outside, were equally well
off, for the spacious grounds were surrounded
by nicely built stone walls that were worked
into chimneys noiselessly as was the building
of Solomon's Temple, and though not quite as
ornamental, were quite as useful, as that fabled
temple of the olden time. The ornamental trees
did not make first-rate firewood on account of
being green, but we had not time for them to
dry, and had to get along with them as best we
could. Here we had plenty of rations; and
vegetables of all kinds were issued to us in
great abundance. The greatest evil we were
compelled to suffer, while here, was the sale of
intoxicating liquor to the soldiers in the city.
The large majority of our regiment were reasonably
temperate men; but, I am sorry to be
compelled to say that there was a large amount
of drunkenness in the army that made the men
difficult to control, and caused very many to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>lose their lives. Drunken officers in command
was a terrible evil.</p>

<p class='c000'>I suppose no city in the United States ever
had so bad a population as the city of Nashville
during the winter of 1864-5. The thieves,
gamblers and disreputable of both sexes,
swarmed in from all over the country, and at
one time the demimonde became such a plague
that General Thomas loaded a steamboat with
them and sent them to Louisville, but the authorities
there refused to let them land, and
what became of them I never knew; it may be
they were destroyed for the good of the service.
It was no uncommon thing to find two or more
dead soldiers, murdered in an unsavory locality
known as Smoky Row, every morning, and the
original inhabitants of the city were none too
good to murder a union soldier if they found
him in a condition not to be able to take care of
himself. If there ever was a city that should
have been disposed of as Atlanta and Columbia
were, that city was Nashville. But things were
getting ripe for action. Every day troops in
squads, detachments and regiments, were coming
in by river and by rail. The 17th Army Corps,
commanded by that gray-headed old hero (noted
for his choice (?) English), General A. J. Smith,
came up and took position at the right of our
corps. General Stedman, that did such good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>work with the reserve corps at Chickamauga,
commanded a division of colored troops on the
extreme left, while more artillery than was ever
before made ready for battle, was being put into
position. There were grave apprehensions that
Hood would cross the river and move into
Kentucky, as Bragg had done in 1862. The
government at Washington became alarmed,
and sent General John A. Logan to relieve
General Thomas. It did seem that the General
was terribly slow, but he was preparing to give
the rebel army such a crushing blow that when
he did strike no second blow would be necessary.
General Logan came as far as Louisville,
and learning how General Thomas was situated
and what he was doing, refused to supersede
him though he had the orders in his pocket to
that effect. <em>Was there a regular officer in the
union service that would have been that magnanimous?</em></p>

<p class='c000'>The morning of the fifteenth of December
opened with everything about our lines and
camps veiled in an impenetrable fog. One
could not see a man ten feet away. Under the
cover of this fog General Thomas opened a
demonstration on the enemy's right that caused
Hood to weaken his left to support his right.
About ten o'clock a. m., as soon as the fog had
lifted a little, Thomas sent the dashing Kilpatrick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>in on Hood's extreme left, followed by a
charge from General A. J. Smith's entire corps.
General Smith's men simply ran over the rebels.
When the rebel left had been badly shattered by
the charge made by Smith, and when the firing
showed the rebel line was crumbling, the 4th
Corps in the center was ordered in, and away
we all went across an open field toward the
rebel works. The rebels in our front occupied a
strong position behind a stone wall that they
had materially strengthened, but seemed to be
dazed by the impetuosity of the charge on the
left and center, and hardly fired a shot. I think
in this charge our brigade captured more of the
enemy than we had men in line. When we
passed the stone wall there was not an armed
rebel in front of us that we could discover. The
firing was over along the entire length of the line,
and some of us thought that we had taken all the
rebels there were out there. I am of the opinion
of all the artillery firing we ever experienced, that
of the battle of Nashville was the most intense.
When the cavalry commenced the charge on
the right, every gun in Fort Negley commenced
firing, as well as all the other forts and all the
field and reserve artillery about Nashville. Of
all the pandemonian scenes we ever witnessed,
this was the climax. The firing was so intense
and ceaseless that not an individual gun could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>be distinguished, but there was one dreadful
roar of shot and shell, and all along the rebel
lines and beyond, the bursting missiles filled
the air with clouds of smoke. I do not believe
its equal was ever before witnessed on the
American continent, if in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>We pushed on to the front and found no
enemy, and for some unexplained reason did
nothing more that day. If we had advanced in
line of battle immediately after the charge in the
morning, I am firmly in the belief that there
would have been no second day's battle. On
the second day we moved to the front early in
the morning, and found that the enemy had
gathered his scattered ranks, and had taken and
fortified a position, his line running across the
Franklin pike. Our regiment was at the left of
the pike in an open wood. Our regiment was
also at the left of the brigade, and joined the
right of Stedman's division of colored troops.
Colonel Post, by reason of seniority of rank, had
command of our brigade, and had been in command
since the 89th Ill. had been added to us
at Atlanta. It seemed the same tactics were
resorted to the second day as the first, and at
four o'clock p. m. we could distinctly hear
Smith's infantry hammering away directly in
the rear of the rebel line. All the afternoon
Colonel Post had been soliciting General Wood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>to order our brigade to charge the rebel position
on the Franklin pike, but could not obtain the
consent of the old general, as he (Wood) said
the charge would result in driving the rebels
away, while by waiting we could get all of them
without any trouble or loss. This was great big
sense, and there was not an officer or man in the
brigade, save Colonel Post, that did not realize
the fact. But our brigade commander was anxious
for a star, and as old Tommy became more
<em>spiritually-minded</em>, he consented to let the old
second brigade charge. The rebels had good
rifle pits, but nothing so strong as on the
Atlanta campaign; but near the pike they had a
battery of field artillery, some of the guns of
which had been disabled early in the day. At
the order to charge we moved on in fine form
until we came near the works, when the rebels
opened on us with canister that momentarily
checked our advance. The colored infantry on
our left seemed to receive the most of the rebel
fire, as Stedman's division was in such a position
that as soon as they came in range they were
enfiladed for more than three hundred yards of
their line, and consequently they suffered much
more severely than our brigade. I never saw
more heroic conduct shown on the field of battle
than was exhibited by this body of men <em>so
recently slaves</em>. I saw a color-bearer of one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>these regiments stand on the top of the rebel parapet
and shake the flag he bore in the faces of the
confederate infantry until he fell, riddled with
bullets. Soon after this, owing to a slight accident
of war, your humble servant was compelled
to go to the rear. But I remember (while lying
on a stretcher) I heard the shout of the old regiment
(that I could tell as I could my mother's
voice), as they carried the rebel works.</p>

<p class='c000'>What I know about the remainder of the battle
of Nashville, and the pursuit of Hood, you of
the old regiment and brigade know better than
I. The rebel infantry ran away, just as old
Tommy had said they would. This charge was
a terribly severe and useless mistake. We had
two brave young officers, Payne<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and Dempsey,
killed, and many noble men killed and wounded.
And all for what? To gratify the ambition of
an officer that desired promotion. "What is
ambition? 'Tis a glorious cheat."</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Post was badly punished for this
foolish and needless charge he had gotten us
into. He received a canister shot through his
right thigh that nearly cost him his life, and in
addition to that suffering <em>he was elected to
Congress from one of the districts of Illinois</em>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Hood's army was completely destroyed.
When the second day of the battle of Nashville
was over, Hood had not a single infantry regiment
in organization. Forrest's cavalry was all
the soldiers on which he could rely. He lost
every piece of artillery, every wagon. Many of
his men were recruited in Tennessee and Kentucky,
and after the battle was over they threw
away their arms and accouterments and went to
their homes, never to enter the service again.
The war in the west was substantially over. Our
regiment never fired another shot after the
charge on Overton Heights. They did some
marching and quite a considerable traveling,
going as far on one occasion as Warm Springs,
N. Car. But their fighting service was over, and
I believe we never lost a man after Nashville.
Corporal Hood, of the confederate army, was
never heard from again, and between Nashville
and Atlanta there were not troops enough wearing
the gray to hinder General Thomas' army
for one hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the campaign from Atlanta to Nashville
closed with the battle, before ending this
very imperfect sketch suffer me to refer to the
last scene at Nashville. The spring of 1865 had
come. The long bloody, cruel war was over.
The wounds had healed. We were in camp in
the vicinity of Nashville, knowing we would
soon be discharged and go to our own loved
Ohio. A grand review of all the troops about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Nashville was ordered. It was to be the last
good-bye of "Old Pap Thomas" to the brave
men he had led so long. Never before was
such preparation made for a review. Every
piece of leather, every piece of brass and steel,
was burnished as bright as time could make it.
Never saw I the old regiment turn out in such
fine shape. All the remnants of the old bands
we had were revived, as far as possible. New
sheepskin was in great demand. I cannot now
tell whether the wheezy old band that General
Hazen had at Manchester was in existence at
that time, or whether it had been sacrificed for
the good of the service <em>and given harps</em>, as it
should have been, long before. The column for
review was formed in divisions of regiments, that
is, two companies to the division. General
Thomas and staff were stationed on a gentle
eminence, the bands playing, the old tattered
colors flying, and as each regiment came opposite
the "Rock of Chickamauga," every hat came
off, and such cheers went up as had not greeted
the old general since the storming of Missionary
Ridge. Just a little drawing about the mouth
was all the expression one could discover in the
iron face of the grand old Virginian.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few years afterward I stood by the last
resting place of General George H. Thomas in
the beautiful cemetery at Troy, N. Y., and while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>standing there I thought, "here lies the remains
of a proud southerner, that 'faithful among the
faithless stood,' that loved his native state as well
as any, but loved his country better, and few, if
any, in life did more to keep the flag of our Union
waiving over a free and united country."</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
